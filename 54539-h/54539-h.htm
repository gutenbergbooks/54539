<p class="hang"><i>Prophecy came not in old time by the will of
man: but holy men of God spake, as they
were moved by the Spirit of God.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> argument from prophecy, in support
of the Christian revelation, would be thought
more conclusive, at least would be more distinctly
apprehended, if men could be kept from
mixing their own prejudices and preconceptions
with it.</p>

<p>The general question may be expressed thus&mdash;“Whether
the predictions in the Old and
New Testament do not appear to have been
so far, and in such sense, fulfilled, as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
afford a reasonable conviction, that they <i>came
not</i>, as the text speaks, <i>by the will of man,
but from the Spirit of God</i>.”</p>

<p>In examining this question, the predictions
themselves cannot be too diligently studied, or
too cautiously applied: But, while this work
is carrying on, we are still to suppose, and
should not for a moment forget, that they <i>may</i>
be, what they manifestly claim to be, of divine
suggestion; I mean, we are to admit, not the
truth indeed, but the possibility, of such suggestion,
till we can fairly make it appear that
they are of human contrivance, only.</p>

<p>It will not be denied, that the tenour of
Scripture, as well as the text, clearly asserts
the divine original and direction of the prophecies.
A just reasoner on the subject will,
therefore, proceed on this supposition, and
only try whether it be well founded. He will
consider, whether the construction of the prophecies,
and the application of them, be such,
as may accord to those pretensions; and will
not argue against them on other principles,
which they do not admit, or suppose. All
this is plainly nothing more than what may be
expected from a fair inquirer, and what the
rules of good reasoning exact from him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>

<p>The use of this conduct would be, To prevent,
or set aside, all those fancies and imaginations
which too frequently mislead inquirers
into the evidence of prophecy; which
fill their minds with needless perplexities, and
disgrace their books with frivolous and impertinent
disquisitions. And, because I take it
to be of principal moment, that this <i>use</i> be
perfectly seen and understood, I shall, <i>first</i>,
apply myself to justify and explain it.</p>

<p>It is true that <i>prophecy</i>, in the very idea of
that term, at least in the scriptural idea of it,
implies the divine agency; and that, exerted
not merely in giving the faculty itself, but in
directing all its operations.</p>

<p>Yet I know not how it is that, when men
address themselves to the study of the prophetic
scriptures, they are apt to let this so necessary
idea slip out of their minds; and to discourse
upon them just as they would or might
do, on the supposition that the prophet was
left at liberty to dispense this gift in all respects,
as he should think proper. No wonder
then, that they should misconceive of its
character, and entertain very different notions
about the exercise of this power from what the
Scriptures give them of it. Nay it is no wonder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
that they should even treat the subject with some
scorn, while they judge of it by the rule of human
prudence, and not of divine wisdom: for,
though they would readily own themselves incapable
of pronouncing on the secret counsels
of God, if prophecy, in its whole administration,
be regarded as proceeding merely from
him; yet, from their knowledge of human nature,
they would think, and with some reason,
they were well able to conceive how the spirit
of prophecy would be administered, if man had
the disposal of this spirit committed to him.</p>

<p>Now it happens, as I said, (by an inexcusable
perverseness, or inattention, indeed, yet
in fact it so happens) that, to the consideration
of the argument from prophecy, as applied to
the proof of the Christian religion, many inquirers
bring with them this strange and fatal
prejudice; and then their reasonings, or rather
conjectures, on the <small>SUBJECT</small>, the <small>END</small>, and the
<small>DISPENSATION</small> of prophecy, are only such, as
this prejudice may be expected to inspire.</p>

<p>I. Judging for ourselves, and by the light of
human investigation only, there might be some
ground for supposing, that, if it should please
God at any time to confer the gift of prophecy
on his favoured servants, they would be solely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
or chiefly commissioned to unfold the future
fortunes of the most conspicuous states and
kingdoms in the world: that so divine a power
would embrace, as its peculiar object, the
counsels and enterprizes, the successes and triumphs
of the most illustrious nations; those
especially, which should rise to the summit
of empire by generous plans of policy, and by
the efforts of public virtue; of <i>free states</i>, in
a word, such as we know to have flourished in
the happier ages of Greece, and such as we
still contemplate with admiration in the vast
and awful fabric of Consular Rome. This we
might think a fit object for the prophetic spirit
to present to us; as corresponding in some degree
to the sublime character of a prophet;
and as most worthy, in our conceptions, of the
divine attention and regard.</p>

<p>But how are we surprized to find that this
astonishing power, the most signal gift of Heaven
to mankind, hath, in its immediate application
at least, respected, many times, obscure
individuals, whose names and memory
are only preserved in one barbarous chronicle,
hath been chiefly employed, and, as we are
ready to express it, thrown away on one single
state, or rather family; inconsiderable in the
extent of its power or territory; sequestered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
from the rest of the nations, and hardly known
among them<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>; with some mention, perhaps,
of greater things, but incidentally touched, as
it may seem, and as they chanced to have
some connexion with the interests of this sordid
people!</p>

<p>Was this a stage, on which it might be expected
that the God of heaven would condescend
to display the wonders of his prescience;
when He kept aloof, as it were, from more
august theatres, and would scarcely vouchsafe
to have the skirts of his glory seen by the
nobler and more distinguished nations of the
World?</p>

<p>Such questions as these are sometimes asked.
But they are surely asked by those, who consider
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
the prophets, as acting wholly on human
views and motives; and not as over-ruled in
all their predictions by <i>the spirit of God</i>. For
it is natural enough for vain man, if left to
himself in the exercise of the prophetic power,
to turn his view towards such objects as appear
to him great, in preference to others; and to
estimate that greatness by the lustre of fame,
in which they shine out to the observation of
mankind. But a moment’s reflection may
shew the probability, the possibility at least,
that <i>God’s thoughts are not as our thoughts</i>;
and that, if the prophet’s foresight be under
the divine influence, there may be reason enough
to direct it towards such scenes and objects, as
we might be apt to undervalue or overlook. It
is even very conceivable, that, if God be the
dispenser of prophecy, and not man, all that
seems great and illustrious in human affairs
may to his all-judging eye appear small and
contemptible<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>; and, on the other hand, what
we account as nothing, may, for infinite reasons,
unknown to us, but so far as he is pleased
to discover them, be of that importance as to
merit the attention of all his prophets from the
foundation of the world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>It is evident, then, that to reason in this
manner on the subject of divine prophecy, is
to suffer ourselves to be misled by a poor and
vulgar prejudice; and to forget, what we
should ever have present to us, the claim of
God’s prophets to speak, not as themselves <i>will</i>,
but as they are <i>moved by his Spirit</i>.</p>

<p>II. The <small>END</small>, or ultimate purpose of prophetic
illumination, is another point, on which
many persons are apt to entertain strange fancies,
and to frame unwarrantable conclusions,
when they give themselves leave to argue on
the low supposition, before mentioned.</p>

<p>1. It is then hastily surmized that the scriptural
prophecies, if any such be acknowledged,
could only be designed, like the Pagan oracles,
to sooth the impatient mind under its anxiety
about future events; to signify beforehand to
states or individuals, engaged in high or hazardous
undertakings, what the issue of them
would be, that so they might suit their conduct
to the information of the prophet, and
either pursue their purpose with vigour, or expect
their impending fate with resignation.
For, what other or worthier end, will some
say, can Heaven propose to itself by these extraordinary
communications, than to prepare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
and qualify such events as it decrees to bring
to pass; to animate desponding virtue, on the
one hand, or to relieve predestined misery, on
the other; to adapt itself, in short, to our necessities
by a clear discovery of its will in those
many intricate situations, which perplex human
prudence, elude human foresight, and,
but for this previous admonition, would bear
too hard on the natural force, or infirmity of
the human mind? Some such idea, as this,
was plainly entertained by those of the Pagan
philosophers who concluded, <i>from the existence
of a divine power, that there must needs
be such a thing as divination</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>. They thought
the attributes of their gods, if any such there
were, concerned in giving some notice of futurity
to mankind.</p>

<p>2. Others, again, encouraged in this conjectural
ingenuity by partial views of scripture,
come to persuade themselves that prophecy is
an act of <i>special grace and favour</i>, not to this
or that state, or individuals, indiscriminately,
as either may seem to stand in need of it; but
to one peculiar and chosen people, who, on
some account or other, had merited this extraordinary
distinction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>Self-love seems to have suggested this idea
to the ancient and modern Jews; and many
others, I doubt, are ready enough to suppose
with them, that prophecy, under the Mosaic
dispensation, had no other reasonable use, or
end.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, there are those who erect their
thoughts to nobler contemplations, and conclude
that this intercourse between heaven and
earth can only be carried on with the sublime
view of preserving an awful sense of Providence
in an impious and careless world.</p>

<p>Vanity, or superstition, may they say, has
suggested to particular men, or to societies of
men, that their personal or civil concerns are
of moment enough to be the subject of divine
prophecies, vouchsafed merely for their own
proper relief or satisfaction. But nothing less
than the maintenance of God’s supreme authority
over his moral creation could be an object
worthy of his interposing in the affairs of men,
in so remarkable a manner. To keep alive in
their minds a prevailing sense of their dependance
upon him, is, then, the ultimate end of
prophecy: and what more suitable (will they
perhaps add, when warmed with this moral
enthusiasm,) to the best ideas we can form of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
divine wisdom, than that this celestial light
should be afforded to such ages or nations as
are most in want of that great and salutary
principle?</p>

<p>There is reason to believe, that many of the
ancient speculatists reasoned thus on the subject
of divination. For, as they argued <i>from
the existence of their gods, to the necessity of
divination</i>; so, again, they turned the argument
the other way, <i>and from the reality of
divination, inferred the existence and providence
of their gods</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>. In drawing the <i>former</i>
conclusion, they shewed themselves to be in
the system of those who maintain, that the
end of prophecy is <i>the instruction of men in
their civil or personal concerns</i>: when they
drew the <i>latter</i>, they seemed to espouse the
more enlarged sentiments of such as make the
end of prophecy to be, <i>The instruction of men
in the general concerns of religion</i>.</p>

<p>I omit other instances, that might be given;
and concern myself no further with these, than
just to observe from them; That the foundation
of all such systems is laid in the prejudices
of their respective patrons; conjecturing rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
what <i>use</i> might be made of this faculty, and
to what purpose men, according to their different
views or capacities, would probably apply
it, than regarding it, with due reverence,
as directed by the spirit of God. For then
they would see, that not one of those ends,
nor any other of human conjecture, could be
safely relied upon, as being that of prophetic
inspiration. Not that all these ends need be
rejected as manifestly unworthy of the divine
intention; perhaps, each of them, in a certain
sense, and with some proper limitation, might
without impiety be conceived to enter into it.
But neither could it be presumed, if none of
those ends could have been pointed out, that
therefore there was no reasonable end of divine
prophecy; nor could it with modesty be
affirmed that the noblest of these ends was
certainly that, which the wisdom of God proposed
chiefly and ultimately to accomplish by
it, unless the information had been given by
himself.</p>

<p>III. But this folly of commenting on prophecy
by the false lights of the imagination is
never more conspicuous, than when the <small>DISPENSATION</small>
of this gift, I mean the <i>mode</i> of its
conveyance, comes to exercise the curiosity of
presumptuous men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>“If it be true, will some say, that the Supreme
Being hath at any time condescended
to enlighten human ignorance by a discovery
of future events, these divine notices, whatever
the <i>end</i> or <i>subject</i> of them might be, must
have been given in terms so precise, and so
clearly predictive of the events to which they
are applied, that no doubt could remain either
about the interpretation or completion of them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, these pretended prophecies
are expressed so ambiguously or obscurely, are
so involved in metaphor and darkened by hieroglyphics,
that no clear and certain sense can
be affixed to them, and the sagacity of a second
prophet seems wanting to explain the
meaning of the first.</p>

<p>Then, again, when we come to verify these
predictions by the light of history, the correspondence
is so slight many times, and so indeterminate,
that none but an easy faith can
assure itself, that they have, in a proper sense,
been fulfilled. At the least, there is always
room for some degree of suspense and hesitation:
either the accomplishment fails in some
particulars, or other events might be pointed
out, to which the prophecy equally corresponds:
so that the result is, a want of that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
entire and perfect conviction, which prophecy,
no doubt, was intended to give, and, when
fulfilled, must supply<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, continue these inquirers, if our prophecies
had been derived from no higher an
original, than that of Pagan oracles, we might
well enough have supposed them to be of this
stamp. When men had nothing to trust to,
in their predictions, but their own ingenuity,
they did well to deal in equivocal or enigmatic
expression, and might leave it to chance, or to
the passions of their votaries, to find an application
for their random conjectures. But
when the prophet is, what he assumes to be,
an interpreter of heaven, he may surely afford
to speak plainly, and to deliver nothing to us
but what shall appear, with the fullest evidence,
to be accomplished in the event.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>The invidious comparison, here made, between
Scriptural prophecies and Pagan oracles,
will be considered in its place. To the general
principle, assumed by these inquirers, <i>That
divine prophecy must be delivered with the utmost
clearness and perspicuity, and fulfilled
with irresistible evidence</i>, it may be sufficient
to reply, as before, That, though these inquirers
use the words, <i>divine prophecy</i>, they
manifestly argue on the supposition of its human
original, or at least application. In this
latter case, indeed, it is likely enough that the
prophet, for his own credit, or for what he
might fancy to be the sole end of prophecy,
might chuse, if he were entrusted with the
knowledge of future events, to predict them
with all possible clearness, and in such sort
that obstinacy itself must see and admit the
completion of them: but then, on the <i>former</i>
supposition, that the prophet was only the minister
and instrument of the divine counsels, in
the high office committed to him, they will do
well to answer, at their leisure, the following
questions.</p>

<p>“How do they know in what manner, and
with what circumstances, it was fit for divine
wisdom to dispense a knowledge of futurity to
mankind? How can they previously determine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
the degree of evidence with which a
prediction must be either given or fulfilled?
What assurance have they, that no reasonable
ends could be served by prophecies, expressed
with some obscurity, and accomplished in a
sense much below what may seem necessary
to unavoidable conviction? Can they even
pretend, on any clear principles of reason, that
very important ends, perhaps the most important,
may not be answered by that mode of
conveyance, which appears to them so exceptionable?
Can they, in a word, determine
before-hand, I do not say with certainty, but
with any colour of probability; what <i>must</i> be
the character of divine prophecy, when they
know not the reason, most undoubtedly not
<i>all</i> the reasons, why it is given, and have even
no right to demand, that it should be given at
all?”</p>

<p>Till these, and other questions of the like
sort, be pertinently answered, it must be in
vain to censure the ways of Providence, as not
corresponding to our imperfect and short-sighted
views.</p>

<p>So much for that <i>capital</i> prejudice taken
from the supposed obscurity of the scriptural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
prophecies. Of <i>smaller</i> scruples and difficulties
on this head, there is no end.</p>

<p>Men may ask, for instance, why the instruments
employed in conveying these celestial
notices to mankind, are frequently so mean
and inconsiderable? The subject of a prediction
is the downfall of some mighty state, or
the fortune of its governours. Why then is
this important revelation intrusted to an obscure
priest, or sordid peasant, in preference to
the great persons, more immediately concerned
in it<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>?</p>

<p>Again; some momentous events have been
signified in dreams: why not to persons
awake, and in the full possession of their best
faculties<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>?</p>

<p>And then, of those dreams, why are they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
sometimes sent to one man, and the interpretation
of them reserved for another<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>?</p>

<p>Why&mdash;But I have done with these frivolous
interrogatories; which, though pressed with
all the advantage of Cicero’s rhetoric, have
really no force against <i>Pagan divination</i>; and
therefore surely none, against <i>Scriptural prophecy</i>;
I mean, in the opinion of those who
respect it least.</p>

<p>In truth, they who put these questions (arguing,
as they must do, on the supposition
that prophecy is divinely inspired) cannot excuse
their presumption, even to themselves:
and they, to whom such questions are proposed,
will not, if they be wise, so much as attempt
to resolve them. For they have the nature
of arguments addressed not only to the
<i>ignorance</i>, as we say, of the disputant, but to
an ignorance clearly <i>invincible</i> by all the
powers of human reason. Now to arguments
of this sort&mdash;<i>I know not</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>&mdash;is the answer of
good sense, as well as of modesty, and, to a
just reasoner, more satisfactory by far, than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
any solution whatever of the difficulty proposed<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.</p>

<p>Not that reason is to be wholly silenced on
the argument of prophecy: for then every species
of imposture would be ready to flow in
upon us. The <i>use</i>, we should make both of
that faculty, and of these preliminary considerations
on the <i>subject</i>, the <i>end</i>, and the <i>dispensation</i>
of prophecy is, briefly, this, To inquire,
whether <i>any</i> prophecies have been given&mdash;in
what sense they are reasonably to be interpreted&mdash;and
how far, and whether in any
proper sense, they have been fulfilled: to examine
them, in a word, by their own claims,
and on the footing of their own pretensions;
that is, to argue on the supposition that they
may be divine, till they can be evidently shewn
to be otherwise.</p>

<p>This is clearly to act suitably to our own faculties;
to keep within the sphere of our duty;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
and to reap the proper benefit, whatever it be,
of a sober inquiry into the authority, and character,
and accomplishment of the prophetic
scriptures.</p>

<p>All the rest is idle cavil, and miserable presumption;
equally repugnant to the clearest
dictates of right reason, and to that respect
which every serious man will think due to the
subject, and to himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<h2 id="SERMON_II">SERMON II.<br />

<span class="large">THE TRUE IDEA OF PROPHECY.</span><br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">Rev.</span> xix. 10.</span></h2>

<p class="table"><i>The testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of
Prophecy.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> is very clear in what manner common
sense instructs us to prosecute all inquiries into
the divine conduct. Wise men <i>collect</i>, from
what they see done in the system of nature, so
far as they are able to collect it, the intention
of its author. They will conclude, in like
manner, from what they find delivered in the
system of revelation, what the views and purposes
of the revealer were.</p>

<p>Prophecy, which makes so considerable a
part of that system, must, therefore, be its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
own interpreter. My meaning is, that, setting
aside all presumptuous imaginations of our
own, we are to take our ideas of what prophecy
<i>should</i> be, from what, in fact, we find it to
have been. If it be true (as the Apostle says,
and as the thing itself speaks) that <i>the things
of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God</i><a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>,
there cannot possibly be any way of acquiring
right notions of prophecy, but by attending to
what the spirit of prophecy hath revealed of
itself. They, who admit the divine original of
those scriptures, which attest the reality, and
alone, as they suppose, contain the records,
of this extraordinary dispensation, are more
than absurd, are impious, if they desert this
principle. And they, who reject or controvert
their claim to such original, cannot, on
any other principle, argue pertinently against
that dispensation.</p>

<p>In short, believers and unbelievers, whether
they would support, or overturn, the system
of prophecy, must be equally governed by the
representation given of it in scripture. The
<i>former</i> must not presume, on any other
grounds, to assert the wisdom and fitness of
that system: and the <i>latter</i> will then take a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
reasonable method of discrediting, if by such
means they can discredit, the pretensions of it.
For, as to vindicate prophecy on any principles
but its own, can do it no honour; so, to oppose
it on any other, can neither prejudice the
cause itself, nor serve any reasonable end of
the opposer.</p>

<p>To scripture then we must go for all the information
we would have concerning the <i>use</i>
and <i>intent</i> of prophecy: and the text, to look
no farther, will clearly reveal this great secret
to us.</p>

<p>But, before we proceed to reason from the
text, in which, as it is pretended, this discovery
is made, it will be necessary to explain
its true meaning.</p>

<p>St. John, in this chapter of the Revelations,
from which the text is taken, had been shewn
the downfall of Babylon, and the consequent
exaltation of the church, in its closest union
with Christ, prefigured under the Jewish idea
of a <i>marriage</i>. To so delightful a vision, the
Angel, in whose presence, and by whose ministry,
this scene of glory had been disclosed,
subjoins this triumphant admonition&mdash;<i>Write</i>,
says he; <i>Blessed are they which are called to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
the marriage of the Lamb. These are the
true sayings of God.</i></p>

<p>The Apostle, struck with this emphatic address,
and contemplating with grateful admiration
so joyful a state of things, and the divinity
of that fore-sight by which it was predicted,
<i>falls down at the angel’s feet to worship
him. But he said into me, See, thou do
it not; I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy
brethren that have the testimony of Jesus:
worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is
the spirit of prophecy.</i></p>

<p>The sense is plainly this: Direct thy acknowledgment
for this important discovery,
and that religious adoration, which it inspires,
to God only who revealed it, and not to <i>me</i>,
who am but thy fellow-servant in this office of
bearing testimony to Jesus: I said <i>in bearing
testimony to Jesus</i>; for know, that <i>the spirit
of prophecy</i>, with which I am endowed, and
by which I am enabled to foretell these great
things, is but, in other words, <i>the testimony of
Jesus</i>; it has no other use or end, but to do
honour to him; the prophet, whether he be
angel or man, is only the minister of God to
bear witness to his Son; and his commission
is ultimately directed to this one purpose of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
manifesting the glories of his kingdom. In
discharging this prophetic office, which thou
admirest so much, I am then but the witness
of Jesus, and so to be considered by thee in no
other light than that of thy fellow-servant.</p>

<p>It is evident from the expression, that the
text was intended to give some <i>special</i> instruction
to the Apostle, whose misguided worship
afforded the occasion of it. For, if the design
had merely been to enforce the general conclusion&mdash;<i>worship
God</i>&mdash;the premises need only
have been&mdash;<i>I am the servant of God, as well
as thou</i>&mdash;for from these premises it had followed,
that therefore God, and not the Angel,
was to be worshiped. But the premises are
not simply, <i>I am thy fellow-servant</i>, but <i>I
am the fellow-servant of those who have the
testimony of Jesus</i>: which clause indeed
infers the same conclusion, as the former;
but, as not being necessary to infer it (for the
conclusion had been just and complete without
it) was clearly added to convey a precise idea
of prophecy itself, as being wholly subservient
to Christ, and having no other use or destination,
under its various forms and in all the
diversities of its administration, but to bear
testimony to him. Therefore the Angel says
emphatically, in explanation of that latter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
clause,&mdash;<i>For the testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy</i>&mdash;or, as the sentence, in
our translation, should have run<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, the order
of its parts being inverted, <i>For the spirit of
prophecy is the testimony of Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>It may not be pretended that no more was
meant by the text, than that <i>the particular</i>
prophecy, here delivered, was in attestation of
Jesus: for then it would have been expressed
with that limitation. The terms, on the other
hand, are absolute and indefinite&mdash;<i>the spirit
of prophecy</i>&mdash;whence we cannot but conclude
that prophecy, in general, is the subject of the
proposition.</p>

<p>We have here, then, a remarkable piece of
intelligence conveyed to us (incidentally indeed
conveyed, but not therefore the less remarkable)
concerning the nature and genius of
prophecy. The text is properly a key put into
our hands, to open to us the mysteries of that
dispensation; which had in view ultimately
the person of Christ and the various revolutions
of his kingdom&mdash;<i>The spirit of prophecy is</i>,
universally, <i>the testimony of Jesus</i><a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>The expression, as I have shewn, is so precise
as to leave no reasonable doubt of its
meaning. Yet it may further serve to justify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
this interpretation, if we reflect, how exactly
it agrees with all that the Jewish prophets
were understood to intend, and what Jesus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
himself and his apostles assert was intended,
by their predictions.</p>

<p>It were endless to enumerate all the Prophecies
of the Old Testament which have been
supposed to point at Jesus: and the controversy
concerning the application of <i>some</i> prophecies
to him may be thought difficult. But
it is very certain that the Jews, before the
coming of Christ, gave this construction to
their scriptures: they even looked beyond the
letter of their sacred books, and conceived <i>the
testimony</i> of the Messiah to be the soul and
end of the commandment. <i>The spirit of prophecy</i>
was firmly believed to intend that
<i>testimony</i>, that the expectation was general of
some such person, as Jesus, to appear among
them, and at the very time in which he made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
his appearance. This, I say, is an undoubted
<i>fact</i>, what account soever may be given of it;
and so far evinces that the <i>principle</i>, delivered
in the text, corresponds entirely to the idea
which the fathers entertained of the prophetic
spirit.</p>

<p>Next, Jesus himself appeals to the <i>spirit of
prophecy</i>, as bearing witness to his person and
dispensation. <i>Search the Scriptures</i>, says he
to the Jews, <i>for in them ye think ye have eternal
life, and they are they which testify of</i> <small>ME</small><a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>.
Two things are observable in these words.
1. If the Jews thought they had <i>eternal life</i> in
their scriptures, they must needs have understood
them in a spiritual sense; for the <i>letter</i>
of them taught no such thing: and I know not
what <i>other</i> spiritual sense, that should lead
them to the expectation of <i>eternal life</i>, they
could put on their scriptures, but that prophetic,
or typical sense, which respected the Messiah.
2. Jesus here expressly asserts, that their
scriptures <i>testified of him</i>. How generally
they did so, he explained at large in that remarkable
conversation with two of his disciples,
after his resurrection, when, <i>beginning
at Moses and</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>the prophets, he expounded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
unto them in</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>the scriptures the things concerning
himself</i><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Apostles</i> of Jesus are frequent and large
in the same appeal to the spirit of prophecy.
<i>Those things</i>, says St. Peter to the Jews, <i>which
God had shewed by the mouth of</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>his prophets,
that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled</i><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>.
And, again, after quoting the authority
of Moses, <i>Yea, and</i> <small>ALL</small> <i>the prophets from
Samuel, and those that follow after, as many
as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these
days</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.</p>

<p>St. Paul seems to have composed some entire
epistles<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>, with a view of shewing that
Christ was prefigured in the Law itself, and
that He was, in truth, the substance of the
whole Jewish dispensation. So thoroughly,
according to him, did <i>the spirit of prophecy</i>
pervade that system, and so clearly did it bear
testimony to Jesus! Whence, in his apology
before Agrippa, we find him asserting of the
whole Christian doctrine, <i>that he said none
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
other things than those which the prophets and
Moses did say should come</i><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.</p>

<p>More citations cannot be necessary on so
plain a point. And I bring these to shew, not
the truth of the principle itself (which is not
now under consideration) but the certainty of
the interpretation, here given to the text. For
I make it say no more (though it says it indeed
more precisely) than the scriptures themselves
were <i>understood</i> by the Jews to say, and
are represented by Jesus and his Apostles, as
<i>actually</i> saying, when I affirm its sense to be,
“That the scope and end of prophecy was the
testimony of Jesus.”</p>

<p>On this principle, then, we are to regulate
all our reasonings on the subject of prophecy.
They who maintain, and they who would confute,
its pretensions, must equally go on this
supposition. If the system of prophecy can be
justified, or so far as it can be justified, on
these grounds, the defence must be thought
solid and satisfactory; because those grounds
are not arbitrarily assumed, but are such as
that system itself acknowledges. On the contrary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
whatever advantage may be fairly taken
of those grounds to discredit prophecy, must
needs be allowed, for the same reason.</p>

<p>Again: On the believer’s scheme, that prophecy
is of divine inspiration, there can be no
<i>presumption</i> in arguing from the grounds, here
supposed, in favour of prophecy. Because,
though all conclusions from a principle of human
invention, must be hazardous and rash,
yet from a principle of divine authority, many
sober and just inferences may be drawn. For
it is one thing, to discover a principle, and
another, to argue justly and cogently from it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the unbeliever, who regards
the whole system of prophecy as of human
invention, must yet be allowed to argue
pertinently from the same grounds, because
they are the proper grounds of that system:
his arguments may be rightly formed, though
the principle, from which he argues, appear
to him of no authority. The rules of logic
will indeed oblige him to argue on that principle;
for, otherwise, he combats, not his adversary’s
position, but a phantom of his own
raising.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>Having premised thus much concerning the
right interpretation of the text, and the important
relation it bears to the present subject, I
should now proceed to inquire what conclusions
naturally and fairly result from it. For
from this assumption, that <i>Jesus is the end of
prophecy</i>, it will, I think, follow very evidently,
that the greater part of those objections which
make so much noise, and are so confidently
urged, on the subject of prophecy, have no
force at all in them.</p>

<p>But, before we enter on that task, it may
be useful to consider more particularly what
the <small>ASSUMED PRINCIPLE</small> itself is, and to pause
a while in contemplation of this idea.</p>

<p>The text, as here interpreted, and in full
consonance with the tenor of the sacred writings,
implies this fact&mdash;that <i>Prophecy</i> in general
(that is, all the prophecies of the Old
and New Testament) hath its ultimate accomplishment
in the history and dispensation of
Jesus.</p>

<p>But now, if we look into those writings, we
find, 1. That prophecy is of a prodigious extent;
that it commenced from the fall of
man, and reaches to the consummation of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
things: that, for many ages, it was delivered
darkly, to few persons, and with large intervals
from the date of one prophecy to that of another;
but, at length, became more clear, more
frequent, and was uniformly carried on in the
line of one people, separated from the rest of
the world, among other reasons assigned, for
this principally, to be the repository of the
divine oracles: that, with some intermission,
the spirit of prophecy subsisted among that
people, to the coming of Christ: that He himself
and his Apostles exercised this power in
the most conspicuous manner; and left behind
them many predictions, recorded in the books
of the New Testament, which profess to respect
very distant events, and even run out to
the end of time, or, in St. John’s expression,
to that period, <i>when the mystery of God shall
be perfected</i><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>.</p>

<p>2. Further, besides the extent of this prophetic
scheme, the dignity of the <i>Person</i>,
whom it concerns, deserves our consideration.
He is described in terms, which excite the
most august and magnificent ideas. He is
spoken of, indeed, sometimes as being <i>the seed
of the woman</i>, and <i>as the son of man</i>; yet so
as being at the same time of more than mortal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
extraction. He is even represented to us, as
being superior to men and angels; as far above
all principality and power, above all that is
accounted great, whether in heaven or in
earth; as the word and wisdom of God; as the
eternal Son of the Father; as the heir of all
things, by whom he made the worlds; as the
brightness of his glory, and the express image
of his person.</p>

<p>We have no words to denote greater ideas,
than these: the mind of man cannot elevate
itself to nobler conceptions. Of such transcendent
worth and excellence is that Jesus said to
be, to whom all the prophets bear witness!</p>

<p>3. Lastly, the declared <i>purpose</i>, for which
the Messiah, prefigured by so long a train of
prophecy, came into the world, corresponds to
all the rest of the representation. It was not
to deliver an oppressed nation from civil tyranny,
or to erect a great civil empire, that is,
to atchieve one of those acts, which history accounts
most heroic. No: it was not a mighty
state, a <i>victor people</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<i>Non res Roman&aelig; perituraque regna</i>&mdash;”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that was worthy to enter into the contemplation
of this divine person. It was another and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
far sublimer purpose, which <span class="smcap">He</span> came to accomplish;
a purpose, in comparison of which,
all our policies are poor and little, and all the
performances of man as nothing. It was to
deliver a world from ruin; to abolish sin and
death; to purify and immortalize human nature;
and thus, in the most exalted sense of
the words, to be the Saviour of all men, and
the blessing of all nations.</p>

<p>There is no exaggeration in this account. I
deliver the undoubted sense, if not always the
very words of scripture.</p>

<p>Consider then to what this representation
amounts. Let us unite the several parts of it,
and bring them to a point. A spirit of prophecy
pervading all time&mdash;characterizing one
person, of the highest dignity&mdash;and proclaiming
the accomplishment of one purpose, the
most beneficent, the most divine, that imagination
itself can project&mdash;Such is the scriptural
delineation, whether we will receive it
or no, of that œconomy, which we call Prophetic!</p>

<p>And now then (if we must be reasoning from
our ideas of <i>fit and right</i>, to the rectitude of
the divine conduct) let me ask, in one word,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
whether, on the supposition that it should ever
please the moral Governor of the world to reveal
himself by prophecy at all, we can conceive
him to do it, in a <i>manner</i>, or for <i>ends</i>
more worthy of him? Does not the <i>extent</i> of
the scheme correspond to our best ideas of that
infinite Being, to whom all duration is but a
point, and to whose view all time is equally
present? Is not the <i>object</i> of this scheme,
the Lamb of God that was slain from the foundation
of the world, worthy, in our conceptions,
of all the honour that can be reflected
upon him by so vast and splendid an œconomy?
Is not the <i>end</i> of this scheme such as we should
think most fit for such a scheme of prophecy
to predict, and for so divine a person to accomplish?</p>

<p>You see, every thing here is of a piece: all
the parts of this dispensation are astonishingly
great, and perfectly harmonize with each other.</p>

<p>We, who admit the divinity of those records,
which represent to us this state of things, cannot
but be infinitely affected with it: since, in
that case, we only contemplate an undoubted
fact, in this representation. And it should
further seem that even those, who question
that authority of scripture, must, if they be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
ingenuous, confess themselves <i>struck</i> by a representation
at once so sublime and consistent.
They require, on all occasions, to have reasons
of what they call <i>fitness</i>, in the divine conduct,
pointed out to them: Can they overlook them
here, where they are so obvious and so convincing?
At least, the credibility of such a
scheme, as that of prophecy is in Scripture represented
to be, appears not, so far as we have
hitherto considered it, to be opposed or lessened
in any degree by our <i>natural</i> prejudices;
by the best notions, I mean, which we can
frame on this subject; but is, indeed, much
<i>strengthened</i> and confirmed by them.</p>

<p>On the idea of such a scheme, as is here
presented to us, I enlarge no farther, at present,
than just to make <small>ONE</small> general observation.
It is this: That the argument from prophecy
is not to be formed from the consideration
of single prophecies, but from all the prophecies
taken together, and considered as making
one system; in which, from the mutual
dependance and connection of its parts, preceding
prophecies prepare and illustrate those
which follow, and these, again, reflect light
on the foregoing: just as, in any philosophical
system, that which shews the solidity of it, is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
the harmony and correspondence of the whole,
not the application of it, in particular instances.</p>

<p>Hence, though the evidence be but small,
from the completion of any one prophecy,
taken separately, yet, that evidence being always
something, the amount of the whole evidence,
resulting from a great number of prophecies,
all relative to the same design, may
be considerable; like many scattered rays,
which, though each be weak in itself, yet,
concentred into one point, shall form a strong
light, and strike the sense very powerfully.
Still more: this evidence is not simply a growing
evidence, but is indeed multiplied upon us,
from the number of reflected lights, which the
several component parts of such a system reciprocally
throw upon each: till, at length, the
conviction rise into a high degree of moral certainty.</p>

<p>It hath been said indeed, of this scheme, or
way of considering prophecy, <i>that it is an
imaginary scheme, of which there is not the
least trace in any of the four Gospels; and
that it even contradicts the whole evidence of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
prophecy, as it was understood and applied by
the Apostles and evangelists</i><a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>.</p>

<p>But what, is there no trace of this scheme
in the Gospel, when Jesus himself <i>began at
Moses and the prophets, and expounded</i> [to
his disciples] <i>in <small>ALL</small> the scriptures the things
concerning himself</i>? Is this scheme contradictory
to the evidence of prophecy, as understood
by the Apostles, when St. Peter argued
with the Jews <i>from what God had spoken by
the mouth of <small>ALL</small> his prophets, since the world
began</i>?</p>

<p>Is not here a series of prophecies, expressly
referred to, as running up not only to the
times of Moses<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>, but to the beginning of the
world? And is not this series argued from,
as constituting one entire system of prophecy,
and as affording an evidence distinct from that
which arises from the consideration of each
prophecy, taken singly and by itself?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>But Jesus and his Apostles, usually, <i>applied
the prophecies singly and independently on
each other, as so many different arguments
for the general truth of the Gospel</i><a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>.</p>

<p>Could they do <i>otherwise</i>, when the occasions
offered, in the course of their ministry, to
which those prophecies were to be applied? Or,
could they do <i>better</i>, in their discourses to the
people, to whom the argument from single
prophecies would be more familiar, than that
complicated one, arising from a whole system?
Does it follow, because the prophecies were
applied singly, that therefore they might not
with good reason be applied systematically; or
that they may not now be so applied, when
we have to do with those, who are capable of
entering into this sort of argumentation? Will
it be said that, because the moral precepts of
the Gospel are delivered singly, there is therefore
no such thing as a system of morality, or
that the subject may not be treated with propriety,
and with advantage too, in that form?</p>

<p>On the whole, the prophecies of the Old
and New Testament, having clearly all the
<i>qualities</i> of what we call a system, that is, consisting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
of many particulars, dependent on each
other, and intimately connected by their reference
to a common end, there is no reason
why they may not be considered in this light;
and there is great reason why they should be
so considered, since otherwise, on many occasions,
we shall not do justice to the argument
itself.</p>

<p>To return then to the text (which implies
the existence and use of such a system) and to
conclude with it. <i>The spirit of prophecy is the
testimony of Jesus.</i> This angelic information
presents, at first sight, an idea stupendous indeed,
but, on such a subject, suitable enough
to our expectations. It offers no violence to
the natural sense of the human mind; but, on
the contrary, hath every thing in it to engage
our belief and veneration.</p>

<p>Such is the <i>idea</i> of Prophecy, contemplated
in itself. What <i>conclusions</i> (of importance, as
we suppose, to the right apprehension and further
vindication of prophecy) may be drawn
from that idea, will be next considered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<span class="large">CONCLUSIONS FROM THE TRUE
IDEA OF PROPHECY.</span><br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">Rev.</span> xix. 10.</span></h2>

<p class="table"><i>The testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of
Prophecy.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">We</span> have seen how precarious all our reasonings
on divine prophecy must be, when
built on no better grounds than those of human
fancy and conjecture. The text supplies us
with a principle, as <i>we</i> believe, of divine authority;
as <i>all</i> must confess, of scriptural authority;
that is, of the same authority as that
on which prophecy itself stands.</p>

<p>This principle has been explained at large.
It affirms that <i>Jesus</i>, whose person and character
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
and history are sufficiently known from
the books of scripture, <i>is the end and object of
the prophetic system</i>, contained in those books.</p>

<p>We are now at liberty to reason from this
principle. Whatever conclusions are fairly
drawn from it, must to the believer appear, as
certain truths; must to the unbeliever appear,
as very proper illustrations of that principle.</p>

<p>In general, if difficulties can be removed by
pursuing and applying scriptural principles,
they are fairly removed: and the removal of
every such difficulty, on these grounds, must
be a presumption in favour of that system,
whether we call it of <i>Prophecy</i>, or <i>Revelation</i>,
which is thus found to carry its own vindication
with it.</p>

<p>From the principle of the text may, I think,
be deduced, among others, the following conclusions;
all of them tending to clear the subject
of prophecy, and to obviate some or other
of those objections, which prejudiced or hasty
reasoners have been disposed to make to it.</p>

<p>I. My first conclusion is, “That, on the
idea of such a scheme of prophecy, as the text
supposes, a considerable degree of obscurity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
may be reasonably expected to attend the <i>delivery</i>
of the divine predictions.”</p>

<p>There are general reasons which shew that
prophecy, as such, will most probably be thus
delivered. For instance, it has been observed,
that, as the completion of prophecy is left, for
the most part, to the instrumentality of free
agents, if the circumstances of the event were
predicted with the utmost precision, either human
liberty must be restrained; or human obstinacy
<i>might</i> be tempted to form, the absurd
indeed, but criminal purpose, of counteracting
the prediction. On the contrary, by throwing
some part of the predicted event into shade,
the moral faculties of the agent have their proper
play, and the guilt of an intended opposition
to the will of heaven is avoided. This
reason seems to have its weight: and many
others might still be mentioned. But I argue,
at present, from the <i>particular</i> principle, under
consideration.</p>

<p>An immense scheme of prophecy was ultimately
designed to bear testimony to the person
and fortunes of Jesus. But Jesus was not
himself to come, till what is called the <i>last age</i>
of the world, nor all the purposes of his coming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
to be fully accomplished, till the <i>end</i> of
that age.</p>

<p>Now, whatever reasons might make it fit, in
the view of infinite wisdom, to defer the execution
of this scheme to so distant a period, may
probably be conceived to make it fit, that the
<i>delivery</i> of it should be proportionably dark
and obscure. A certain degree of light, we
will say, was to be communicated from the
date of the prophecy: but it is very conceivable
that the ages nearer the completion of it,
might be more immediately concerned in the
event predicted; and that, till such time approached,
it might be convenient to leave the
prediction in a good degree of obscurity.</p>

<p>The fact answers to this presumption. Prophecies
of very remote events, remote, I mean,
from the date of the prediction, are universally
the most obscure. As the season advanced for
their accomplishment, they are rendered more
clear: either fresh prophecies are given, to
point out the time, and other circumstances,
more determinately; or the completion of some
prophecies affords new light for the interpretation
of others, that are unfulfilled. Yet neither
are we to conceive that those <i>fresh prophecies</i>,
or this <i>new light</i> removes all obscurity:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
enough is still left to prevent or disappoint
the efforts of presumption; and only so
much additional clearness is bestowed on the prophecy,
as the revealer saw fit to indulge to those
who lived nearer the time of its completion.</p>

<p>But this is not all: By looking into that
plan of providence, which respects Jesus, and
the ends to be accomplished by him, as it is
drawn out in the sacred writings, we find a
<i>distinct</i> reason for the obscurity of the prophecies,
relative to that subject.</p>

<p>We there find it to have been in the order
of the divine councils, that, between the first
dawnings of revelation and the fuller light of
the Gospel, an intermediate and very singular
œconomy, yet still preparatory to that of Jesus,
should be instituted. This œconomy (for reasons,
which it is not to our present purpose to deduce,
and for some, no doubt, which we should in vain
attempt to discover) was to continue for many
ages, and <i>while</i> it continued, was to be had in
honour among that people, for whom it was more
immediately designed. But now the genius of
those two dispensations, the Jewish, I mean,
and the Christian, being wholly different; the
one, carnal, and enforced by temporal sanctions
only, the other, spiritual, and established
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
on better promises, the prophets, who lived
under the former of these dispensations (and
the greater part of those, who prophesied of
Jesus, lived under it) were of course so to predict
the future œconomy, as not to disgrace
the present. They were to respect the <i>Law</i>,
even while they announced the <i>Gospel</i>, which
was, in due time, to supersede it<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>.</p>

<p>So much, we will say, was to be discovered
as might erect the thoughts of men towards
some better scheme of things, hereafter to be
introduced; certainly so much, as might sufficiently
evince the divine intention in that
scheme, when it should actually take place;
but not enough to indispose them towards that
state of discipline, under the yoke of which
they were then held. From this double purpose,
would clearly result that character, in
the prophecies concerning the new dispensation,
which we find impressed upon them;
and which St. Peter well describes, when he
speaks of them, as dispensing a light indeed,
but <i>a light shining in a dark place</i>.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the delivery of prophecy
seems well suited to that dispensation which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
was given to attest. If the object in view had
been one single event, to be accomplished all
at once, it might perhaps be expected that the
prophecies concerning it would have been clear
and precise. But, if the scheme of Christianity
be what the scriptures represent it to be,
a scheme, commencing from the foundation of
the world, and unfolding itself by just degrees
through a long succession of ages, and to be
fully accomplished only at the consummation
of all things, <i>prophecy</i>, which was given to attend
on that scheme, and to furnish a suitable
attestation to it, must needs be supposed to
adapt itself to the nature of the dispensation;
that is, to have different degrees of clearness or
obscurity according to its place in the general
system; and not to disclose more of it, or in
clearer terms, at any one period, than might
consist with the various ends of wisdom which
were to be served by the gradual opening of so
vast and intricate a scene.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> circumstance, of affinity with this,
is apt to strike us, in the contemplation of the
scriptural prophecies. There is reason to believe
that more than one sense was purposely
inclosed in some of them; and we find, in
fact, that the writers of the New Testament
give to many of the old prophecies an interpretation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
very different and remote from that
which may be reasonably thought the primary
and immediate view of the prophets themselves.
This is what Divines call the <small>DOUBLE SENSE</small> of
prophecy: by which they mean an accomplishment
of it in more events than one; in the
same system indeed; but at distant intervals,
and under different parts of that system.</p>

<p>Now, as suspicious as this circumstance may
appear at first sight, it will be found, on inquiry,
to be exactly suited to that idea of prophecy
which the text gives us of it, as being,
from the first, and all along, intended to <i>bear
Testimony to Jesus</i>. For from that idea I
conclude again,</p>

<p>II. “That prophecies of a <i>double sense</i> may
well be expected in such a scheme.”</p>

<p>And where is the wonder that, if prophecy
was given to attest the coming of Jesus and the
dispensation to be erected by him, it should
occasionally, in every stage of it, respect its
main purpose; and, though the immediate
object be some other, it should never lose
sight of that, in which it was ultimately to
find its repose and end?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span></p>

<p>It hath been before observed, That, between
the earlier notices concerning Jesus, and the
advent of that great person, it seemed good to
infinite wisdom (I speak in terms, suited to the
representation of scripture) to institute the intermediate
œconomy of the Jewish Law.
Among other provisions for the administration
of this Law, <i>prophecy</i> was one; and, upon its
own pretensions, a necessary one; for the government
claims to be strictly <i>theocratical</i>;
and the people, to be governed by it, were to
be made sensible, at every step, that it was so.
Therefore the interesting events in their civil
history were to be regarded by them, as coming
within the cognisance, and lying under
the controul, of their divine governour: to which
end, a race of men were successively raised up
among them, to give them warning of those
events, and, by this divine foresight of what
was seen to be accomplished in their history,
to afford a clear conviction, that they were, in
fact, under that peculiar government.</p>

<p>Add to this, that the <i>Law</i> itself, so wonderfully
constructed, was but a part, indeed the
rudiments, of one great scheme; was given,
not for its own sake, but to make way for a
still nobler and more generous institution; was,
in truth, a preparatory state of discipline, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
<i>p&aelig;dagogy</i>, as St. Paul terms it, to bring the
subjects of it, in due time, to <i>Christ</i><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>.</p>

<p>Jesus then, the object of the earliest prophecies,
was not overlooked in this following
dispensation; which was, indeed, instinct with
presages of that divine person. <i>It gave the
shadow of good things to come, but the body
was of Christ</i><a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>. The <i>legal</i> prophets, in like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
manner, while they were immediately employed,
and perhaps believed themselves to be
solely employed, in predicting the occurrences
of the Jewish state, were at the same time,
preluding, as it were, to the person and dispensation
of Jesus; the holy Spirit, which inspired
them, bearing out their expression, and enlarging
their conceptions, beyond the worth
and size of those objects, which came directly
in their view.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this account of <i>prophecy</i>,
but what falls in with our best ideas of the divine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
wisdom; intently prosecuting one entire
scheme; and directing the constituent parts of
it to the general purpose of his providence, at
the same time that <i>each</i> serves to accomplish
its own.</p>

<p>This <i>double</i>, or <i>secondary sense</i> of prophecy
was so far from giving offence to Lord
Bacon, that he speaks of it with admiration,
as one striking argument of its Divinity. <i>In
sorting the prophecies of scripture with their
events</i> (a work much desired by this wise author,
and intended by this Lecture) <i>we must
allow</i>, says he, <i>for that latitude which is
agreeable and familiar unto divine prophecies,
being of the nature of the author, with whom
a thousand years are but as one day; and
therefore they are not fulfilled punctually at
once, but have springing and germinant accomplishment
throughout many ages, though
the height or fulness of them may refer to
some one age</i><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>.</p>

<p>But, that we may not mistake, or pervert,
this fine observation of our great philosopher,
it may be proper to take notice, that the reason
of it holds in such prophecies only as respect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
the several successive parts of one system;
which, being intimately connected together,
may be supposed to come within the view and
contemplation of the same prophecy: whereas
it would be endless, and one sees not on what
grounds of reason we are authorized, to look
out for the accomplishment of prophecy in any
casual unrelated events of general history. The
Scripture speaks of prophecy, as respecting
Jesus, that is, as being one connected scheme
of Providence, of which the Jewish dispensation
makes a part: so that here we are led to
expect that <i>springing and germinant accomplishment</i>,
which is mentioned. But had the
Jewish Law been complete in itself, and totally
unrelated to the Christian, the general principle&mdash;<i>that
a thousand years are with God but
as one day</i>&mdash;would no more justify us in extending
a Jewish prophecy to Christian events,
because perhaps it was eminently fulfilled in
them, than it would justify us in extending it
to any other signally corresponding events
whatsoever. It is only when the prophet hath
one uniform connected design before him, that
we are authorised to use this latitude of interpretation.
For then the prophetic spirit naturally
runs along the several parts of <i>such</i> design,
and unites the remotest events with the
nearest: the style of the prophet, in the mean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
time, so adapting itself to this double prospect,
as to paint the near and subordinate event in
terms that <i>emphatically</i> represent the distant
and more considerable.</p>

<p>So that, with this explanation, nothing can
be more just or philosophical, than the idea
which Lord Bacon suggests of divine prophecy.</p>

<p>The great scheme of Redemption, we are
now considering, being the only scheme in the
plan of Providence, which, as far as we know,
hath been prepared and dignified by a continued
system of prophecy, at least this being
the only scheme to which we have seen a prophetic
system applied, men do not so readily
apprehend the doctrine of <i>double senses</i> in prophecy,
as they would do, if they saw it exemplified
in other cases. But what the history of
mankind does not supply, we may represent to
ourselves by many obvious suppositions; which
cannot justify, indeed, such a scheme of things,
but may facilitate the conception of it.</p>

<p>Suppose, for instance, that it had been the
purpose of the Deity (as it unquestionably was)
to erect the <small>FREE GOVERNMENT</small> of ancient
Rome; and that, from the time of &AElig;neas’
landing in Italy, he had given prophetic intimations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
of this purpose. Suppose, further,
that he had seen fit, for the better discipline of
his favoured people, to place them, for a season,
under the <i>yoke</i> of the Regal government;
and that, during that state of things, he had
instructed his prophets to foretell the wars and
other occurrences which should distinguish that
period of their history.&mdash;Here would be a case
somewhat similar to that of the Jews under
their theocratic regimen: not exactly indeed,
because prophecy, as we have seen, was essential
to the Jewish polity, but had nothing to
do with the regal, or any other polity of the
Romans. But allow for this difference, and
suppose that, for some reason or other,
the spirit of prophecy was indulged to this
people, under their <i>kings</i>, as it was to the
Jews, under their <i>theocracy</i>; and that it was
<i>primarily</i> employed in the same way, that is,
in predicting their various fortunes under that
regimen: Suppose, I say, all this, and would
it surprize us to find that their prophets, in
dilating on this part of their scheme, should,
in a <i>secondary</i> sense, predict the future and
more splendid part of it? That, having the
whole equally presented to their view, they
should anticipate the coming glories of their
<i>free</i> state, even in a prophecy which directly
concerned their <i>regal</i>, and much humbler
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
successes? That, in commenting on their petty
victories over the Sabins and Latins, they
should drop some hints that pointed at their
African and Asiatic triumphs; or, in tracing
the shadow of freedom they enjoyed under the
best of their kings, they should let fall some
strokes, that more expressly designed the substantial
liberty of their equal republic: the
<i>end</i>, as we suppose, and completion of that
scheme, for the sake of which the prophetic
power itself had been communicated to them?
Still more: supposing we had such prophecies
now in our hands, and that we found them
applicable indeed in a general way to the former
parts of their history, but frequently more
expressive of events in the latter, should we
doubt of their being prophecies in a <i>double
sense</i>, or should we think it strange that two
successive and dependent dispensations in the
same connected scheme should be, at once, the
object of the same predictions? And lastly, to
put an end to these questions, could there
seem to be equal reason for applying these predictions
to such events as might possibly correspond
to them in some <i>other</i> history, the
Gr&aelig;cian, for instance, as for applying them to
similar events in the <i>Roman</i> history?</p>

<p>Let me just observe further, that, from
what hath been said under these two articles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
we may clearly discern the difference between
<i>Pagan oracles</i>, and <i>Scriptural prophecies</i>.
Both have been termed obscure and ambiguous;
and an invidious parallel hath been made,
or insinuated, between them<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>. The Pagan
oracles were indeed <i>obscure</i>, sometimes to a
degree that no reasonable sense could be made
of them: they were also <i>ambiguous</i>, in the
worst sense; I mean, so as to admit contrary
interpretations. The scriptural prophecies we
own to be <i>obscure</i>, to a certain degree: And
we may call them, too, <i>ambiguous</i>; because
they contained two, consistent, indeed, but
different meanings. But here is the distinction,
I would point out to you. The obscurity
and ambiguity of the Pagan oracles had no necessary,
or reasonable cause in the subject, on
which they turned: the obscurity and ambiguity
of the scriptural prophecies have an
evident reason in the system, to which they
belong. As the Pagan predictions had near
and single events for their object, the fate perhaps
of some depending war, or the success of
some council, then in agitation, they might
have been clearly and precisely delivered; and
in fact we find that such of the Jewish predictions
as foretold events of that sort and character,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
were so delivered: But, the scriptural
prophecies under consideration respecting one
immense scheme of Providence, it might be expedient
that the remoter parts should be obscurely
revealed; as it was surely natural that
the connected parts of such a scheme should
be shewn together.</p>

<p>We see then what force there is in that
question, which is asked with so much confidence&mdash;“<i>Is
it possible, that the same character
can be due to the Jewish prophecies,
which the wise and virtuous in the heathen
world considered as an argument of fraud
and falshood in the Pythian prophecies<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>?</i>”</p>

<p><i>First</i>, we say, the character is <i>not</i> entirely
the same in both: and, <i>secondly</i>, that, so far
as it <i>is</i> the same, that character is very becoming
in the Jewish, but utterly absurd in the
Pythian prophecies. What was owing to fraud
or ignorance in the Pagan Diviner, is reasonably
ascribed to the depth and height of that
wisdom, which informed the Jewish Prophet<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>.</p>

<p>To proceed with our subject. It further appears,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>III. On the grounds of the text, we now
stand upon, “to be very conceiveable and credible
that the line of prophecy should run
chiefly in one family and people, as we are informed
it did, and that the other nations of the
earth should be no further the <i>immediate</i> objects
of it, than as they chanced to be connected
with that people.”</p>

<p>Prophecy, in the ideas of scripture, was not
ultimately given for the private use of this or
that nation, nor yet for the nobler and more
general purpose of proclaiming the superintending
providence of the Deity (an awful
truth, which men might collect for themselves
from the established constitution of nature) but
<i>simply</i> to evidence the truth of the Christian
revelation. It was <i>therefore</i> confined to one
nation, purposely set apart to preserve and attest
the oracles of God; and to exhibit, in their
public records and whole history, the proofs
and credentials of an amazing dispensation,
which God had decreed to accomplish in Christ
Jesus<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>This conclusion, I say, seems naturally and
fairly drawn from the great principle, that <i>the
spirit of prophecy was the testimony of Jesus</i>,
because the means appear to be well suited and
proportioned to the <i>end</i>. The <i>Testimony</i>
thought fit to be given, was not one or two
prophecies only, but a <i>scheme</i> of prophecy,
gradually prepared and continued through a
large tract of time. But how could such a
scheme be executed, or rather how could it
clearly be seen that there was such a scheme
in view, if some <i>one</i> people had not been made
the repository, and, in part, the instrument of
the divine counsels, in regard to Jesus; some
<i>one</i> people, I say, among whom we might
trace the several parts of such a scheme, and
observe the dependance they had on each
other; that so the <i>idea</i>, of what we call a
scheme, might be duly impressed upon us?</p>

<p>For, had the notices concerning the Redeemer
been dispersed indifferently among <i>all</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
nations, where had been that uncorrupt and
unsuspected testimony, that continuity of evidence,
that unbroken chain of prediction, all
tending, by just degrees, to the same point,
which we now contemplate with wonder in the
Jewish scriptures?</p>

<p>It is not then that the rest of the world was
overlooked<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> in the plan of God’s providence,
but that he saw fit to employ the ministry of
<i>one</i> people: This last, I say, and not the other,
is the reason why the divine communications
concerning Christ were appropriated to the
Jews.</p>

<p>Yes, but “some one of the <i>greater</i> nations
had better been intrusted with that charge.”
This circumstance, I allow, might have struck
a superficial observer more: but could the integrity
of the prophetic scheme have been more
discernible amidst the multiform and infinitely
involved transactions of a mighty people, than
in the simpler story of this small Jewish family;
or would the hand or work of God, who loves
to manifest himself by weak instruments, have
been more conspicuous in that designation?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>On the whole, I forget not, with what awful
diffidence it becomes us to reason on such subjects.
But the <i>fact</i> being, that <i>one</i>, in preference
to other nations, had the honour of
conveying the prophetic admonitions concerning
Jesus, it may be allowable to inquire, with
modesty, into the reasons of that appointment,
and the <i>end</i> of prophecy being clearly assigned
in sacred scripture, such reasons will not be
hastily rejected, as obviously present themselves
to an inquirer from the <i>consideration</i> of
that end.</p>

<p>The benefits of prophecy, though conveyed
by one nation, would finally redound to all;
and the more <i>effectually</i>, we have seen, for
being conveyed by one nation. May we not
conclude then (having the <i>fact</i>, as I said, to
reason upon) that, to obtain such purpose, it
was fit to select <i>a peculiar people</i>? And, if
thus much be acknowledged, it will hardly be
thought a question of much moment, though
no answer could be given to it, why the <i>Jews</i>
had that exclusive privilege conferred upon
them.</p>

<p>It is true, a great scheme of prophecy was
once revealed to a Gentile King<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>; but a King,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
connected with the Jews, and who had a Jewish
prophet for his interpreter. It is, besides,
observable of that prophetic scheme, that it
laid open the future fortunes of four great empires;
but all of them instruments in the hand
of God to carry on his designs, on the Jewish
people first, but ultimately, with regard to
Jesus. For it hath been remarked with equal
truth and penetration, that Nebuchadnezzar’s
vision of the four kingdoms was designed, as a
sort of <i>prophetic chronology</i>, to point out, by
a series of successive empires, the beginning
and end of Christ’s spiritual Kingdom. So
that the reason, why those four empires only
were distinguished by the spirit of prophecy,
was, not because they were greater than all
others, but simply because the course of their
history led, in a regular and direct succession,
to the times and reign of Christ<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>We see then, on the principle, <i>that prophecy
was given for the sake of Jesus only</i>,
that no presumption lies against the truth of it,
on account of its respecting chiefly one people,
how inconsiderable soever in itself, or from its
silence in regard to some of the largest and
most flourishing kingdoms that have appeared
in the world.</p>

<p>IV. Lastly (for I now hasten to an end of
this discourse) I infer from the same principle,
“That, if, even after a mature consideration
of the prophecies, and of the events, in which
they are taken to be fulfilled, there should,
after all, be some cloud remaining on this subject,
which with all our wit or pains we cannot
wholly remove, this state of things would afford
no objection to prophecy, because it is indeed
no other than we might reasonably expect.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>For, 1. If Jesus be the end of prophecy, the
same reasons that made it fit to deliver some
predictions darkly, will further account to us
for some degree of obscurity in the application
of them to their corresponding events.</p>

<p>I say&mdash;will <i>account</i> to us for such obscurity&mdash;for,
whatever those <i>reasons</i> were, they could
not have taken effect, but by the intervention
of such <i>means</i>, as must darken in some degree,
the application of a prophecy, even after the
accomplishment of it; unless we say, that an
object can be seen as distinctly through a <i>veil</i>,
as without one. For instance: <i>figurative language</i>
is the chief of those means, by which it
pleased the inspirer to throw a shade on prophecies,
unfulfilled; but figurative language,
from the nature of it, is not so precise and clear,
as <i>literal expression</i>, even when the event prefigured
has lent its aid to illustrate and explain
that language.</p>

<p>If then it was <i>fit</i> that some prophecies concerning
Jesus should be <i>delivered</i> obscurely, it
cannot be supposed that such prophecies, when
they come to be <i>applied</i>, will acquire a full
and absolute perspicuity<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>2. If the dispensation of Jesus be the main
subject of the prophecies, then may some of
them be still impenetrable to us, because the
various fortunes of that dispensation are not yet
perfectly disclosed, and so some of them may
not hitherto have been fulfilled. But the completion
of a prophecy is that which gives the
utmost degree of clearness, of which it is capable.</p>

<p>3. But lastly and chiefly, if the end and use
of prophecy be to attest the truth of Christianity,
then may we be sure that such attestation
will not carry with it the utmost degree
of evidence. For Christianity is plainly a state
of discipline and probation: calculated to improve
our moral nature, by giving scope and
exercise to our moral faculties. So that,
though the evidence for it be <i>real</i> evidence,
and on the whole <i>sufficient</i> evidence, yet
neither can we expect it to be of that sort
which should compel our assent. Something
must be left to quicken our attention, to excite
our industry, and to try the natural ingenuity
of the human mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Had the purpose of prophecy been to shew,
merely, that a predicted event was foreseen,
then the end had been best answered by throwing
all possible evidence into the completion.
But its concern being to shew this to such only
as should be disposed to admit a reasonable degree
of evidence, it was not necessary, or rather
it was plainly not fit, that the completion
should be seen in that strong and irresistible
light<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>.</p>

<p>For all the reasons, now given, (and doubtless,
for many more) it was to be expected,
that prophecy would not be one cloudless
emanation of light and glory. If it be clear
enough to serve the ends, for which it was designed;
if through all its obscurities, we be
able to trace the hand and intention of its divine
author; what more would we have? How
improvidently, indeed, do we ask more of that
great Being, who, for the sake of the <i>natural</i>
world, <i>clothes the heavens with blackness</i> [Is.
1. 3.]; and in equal mercy to the <i>moral</i> world,
veils his nature and providence <i>in thick clouds,
and makes darkness his pavilion</i> [Ps. xviii.
11]?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To these</span> deductions from the text, more
might be added. For I believe it will be found
that if the <i>end</i> of prophecy, as here delivered,
be steddily kept in view and diligently pursued,
it will go a great way towards leading us to a
prosperous issue in most of those inquiries,
which are thought to perplex this subject. But
I mean to reason from it no farther than just
to shew, in the way of specimen, the method
in which it becomes us to speculate on the
prophetic system. We are not to imagine
principles, at pleasure, and then apply them
to that system. But we are, first, to find out
what the principles are, on which prophecy is
founded, and by which it claims to be tried;
and then to see whether they will <i>hold</i>, that is,
whether they will aptly and properly apply to
the particulars, of which it is compounded. If
they will, the system itself is thus far clearly
justified. All that remains is to compare the
prophecies with their corresponding events, in
order to assure ourselves that there is real evidence
of their completion.</p>

<p>The <i>use</i> of this method has been shewn in
<small>FOUR</small> capital instances. It is objected to the
scriptural prophecies, <i>that they are obscure</i>&mdash;<i>that
they abound in double senses</i>&mdash;<i>that they
were delivered to one people</i>&mdash;<i>that, after all,</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
<i>there is sometimes difficulty in making out the
completion</i>&mdash;all of them, it is said, very suspicious
circumstances; and which rather indicate
a scheme of human contrivance, than of divine
inspiration.</p>

<p>To these objections it is replied, that, from
the very idea which the scriptures themselves
give of prophecy, these circumstances must
needs be found in it; and further still, that
these circumstances, when fairly considered,
do honour to that idea: for that the obscurity,
complained of, results, <i>from the immensity of
the scheme</i>&mdash;the double senses, <i>from the intimate
connection of its parts</i>&mdash;the partial and
confined delivery, <i>from the wisdom and necessity
of selecting a peculiar people to be the vehicle
and repository of the sacred</i> oracles&mdash;And
lastly, the incomplete evidence, <i>from the
nature of the subject, and from the moral
genius of that dispensation, to which the
scheme of prophecy itself belongs</i>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is now seen to what purpose
these preliminary discourses serve, and in
what method they have been conducted.</p>

<p>The <small>FIRST</small>, shewed the vanity and folly of
reasoning on the subject of scriptural prophecy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
from our preconceived fancies and arbitrary
assumptions. The <small>SECOND</small>, shewed the only
true way of reasoning upon it to be from scriptural
principles, and then opened and explained
<i>one</i> such principle. In this <small>LAST</small>, I have shewn
that, by prosecuting this way of reasoning from
the principle assigned, some of the more specious
objections to the scriptural prophecies are
easily obviated.</p>

<p>Taken together, these three discourses serve
to illustrate the <i>general</i> idea of prophecy, considered
as one great scheme of <i>testimony</i> to the
religion of Jesus; and consequently open a
way for the fair and equitable consideration of
<i>particular</i> prophecies, the more immediate
subject of this Lecture.

<span class="large">THE GENERAL ARGUMENT
FROM PROPHECY.</span><br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">John</span> xiii. 19.</span></h2>

<p class="hang"><i>Now I tell you before it come, that when it is
come to pass, ye may believe, that I am He.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> hath been concluded (not on the slight
grounds of hypothesis, but on the express
authority of scripture,) that prophecy was
given <span class="smcap">to attest the mission of Jesus</span>: to
afford a reasonable evidence, that the scheme
of redemption, of which he was the great instrument
and minister, was, in truth, of divine
appointment; and was carried on under
the immediate cognizance and direction of the
Supreme Being, whose prerogative it is to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
through all time, and to <i>call those things,
which be not, as though they were</i><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>.</p>

<p>Our next inquiry will be, how the prophetic
scriptures <i>serve</i> to that end, and what that
<i>evidence</i> is (I mean, taking for granted, not
the truth of the prophetic scheme itself, but
the truth of the <i>representation</i>, given of it in
scripture) which is thus administered to us by
the light of prophecy.</p>

<p>I. The text refers to a particular prophecy
of our Lord, concerning the treachery of Judas;
of which, says he to his disciples, <i>I now tell
you before it come, that, when it is come to
pass, ye may believe that I am He</i>: that is,
“I add this, to the other predictions concerning
myself; that, when ye see it fulfilled, as it
soon will be, ye may be the more convinced
of my being the person, I assume to be, the
<i>Messias foretold</i>.”</p>

<p>The information, here given, was perhaps
intended by our Lord to serve a particular purpose,
To prevent, we will say, the offence,
which the disciples might have taken at the
circumstance of his being betrayed by one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
them, if they had not, previously, been admonished
of it. But the reason of the thing
shews, that the <i>use</i>, which the disciples are
directed to make of this prophecy, was the
<i>general</i> use of the prophecies concerning Jesus.
The completion was to verify the prediction,
in all cases; and to convince the world, That
<span class="smcap">He</span> was the Messiah, in whom such things
should be seen to be accomplished, as had been
expressly foretold<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed prophecies, unaccomplished, may
have their use; that is, they may serve to
raise a general expectation of a predicted <i>event</i>
in the minds of those, who, for other reasons,
regard the <i>person</i> predicting it, in the light of
a true prophet. And such might be one, a
<i>subordinate</i>, use of the prophecies concerning
Jesus: but they could not be applied to the
<i>proof</i> of his pretensions, till they were seen to
be fulfilled. Nor can they be so applied even
then, unless the things predicted be, confessedly,
beyond the reach of human foresight.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, the argument is
clear and easy, and will lie thus.&mdash;“A great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
variety of distant, or, at least, future events,
inscrutable to human sagacity, and respecting
one person (whom we will call, Messiah) have
been by different men, and at different times,
predicted. These events have accordingly
come to pass, in the history and fortunes of
one person; in such sort, that each is seen to
be, in a proper sense, fulfilled in him, and all
together in no other person whatsoever: Therefore
the prediction of these events was divinely
inspired: or (which comes to the same thing)
therefore the person, claiming under these
predictions to be the Messiah, or person foretold,
hath his claims confirmed and justified
by the highest authority, that of God
himself.”</p>

<p>Such is the argument from prophecy<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>: and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
on this foundation, Jesus assumes to be the
<span class="smcap">Messiah</span>; and his religion, to be <small>DIVINE</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>II. Let us now see, what the amount of that
<i>evidence</i> is, which results from this kind of
proof.</p>

<p>Careless talkers may say, and sometimes
think, “that prophecy is but an art of conjecturing
shrewdly; that the sagacity of one man
is seen to be vastly superior to that of another;
that, in some men, the natural faculty may
be so improved by experience, as to look like
<i>divination</i>; and that no precise bounds can be
set to its powers.” Light or sceptical minds
may, I say, amuse themselves with such fancies:
but serious men will readily acknowledge,
That many future events, especially, if <i>remote</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
or <i>extraordinary</i><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>, or described with some degree
of <i>particularity</i>, are not within the ability
of the human mind to predict. And, to cut
off all occasion of cavil, let it be owned, that
the argument under consideration is, or ought
to be, drawn from the completion of prophecies,
so qualified.</p>

<p>To evade the force, which this argument apparently
carries with it, it must then be said,
That the completion of any particular prophecy,
alleged, was fortuitous, or, what we
call, a <i>lucky hit</i>.</p>

<p>“Coincidencies of this sort, we may be told,
are very frequent. In the ceaseless revolution
of human affairs, some event or other will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
turning up, which may give a countenance to
the wildest and most hazardous conjecture.
Hence it is, that every groundless fear, every
dream, almost, has the appearance of being
realized by some corresponding accident;
which will not be long in occurring to those,
who are upon the watch to make such discoveries.
Upon these grounds, the superstition
of <i>omens</i> hath, at all times, been able to sustain
itself; and to acquire a degree of credit, even
with wise men. We see, then, that <i>chance</i>,
in a good degree, supplies the place of inspiration:
and that He, who sets up for a Prophet,
is likely to drive a safe, as well as gainful
trade; especially, if he have but the discretion
not to deal too freely in precise descriptions of
<i>times</i>, and <i>persons</i><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>: a consideration, of great
moment to the men of this craft<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>; and which
hath not been overlooked by those, whom we
account <i>true</i> prophets.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>Such libertine reflections, as these, thrown
out with an air of negligent ridicule, have too
often the effect intended by them. At the
same time, they disgust sober men, and are
thought too light and trivial to deserve a confutation.
But, because I take these suggestions,
with whatever levity, or disingenuity,
they may be made, to contain the whole, or
at least, the chief strength of the infidel cause,
on this subject, I shall not decline to give them
a very serious answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It is true</span>, no doubt, what is here alledged,
That the conjectures of fanciful or designing
men, whether grounded on casual signs, or
delivered in the direct way of prophecy, have
been frequently verified in the events: that is,
such events have actually come to pass, in the
sense put upon the <i>sign</i>, when it was observed,
and in the literal sense of the <i>prophecy</i>, as delivered.
History and common life, it is agreed,
abound in such instances<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>: and I shall even
make no scruple to produce <i>one</i> of each sort;
as much, at least, to the purpose of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
objectors, as any of those, which they have
produced for themselves.</p>

<p>Nothing is more famous in the annals of ancient
Rome, than the story of Romulus, and
his <small>TWELVE VULTURES</small>; an <i>omen</i> this, on which
the auspicious name of the rising city, and the
fortune of its founder, were, at once, established<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>.
What further construction was then
put on this prodigy, doth not appear: but, as
the science of augury advanced in succeeding
times, a very momentous and striking prophecy
was grounded upon it. For we have it
affirmed<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>, on the high authority of <span class="smcap">M. T.
Varro</span>, that Vettius Valens, an augur of distinguished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
name in those days, took occasion
from this circumstance (and in the hearing of
Varro himself) to fix the duration of the Roman empire.
The <small>TWELVE VULTURES</small>, he said,
which appeared to Romulus, <i>portended</i>, that
the sovereignty of that state and city, whose
foundations he was then laying, should continue
for the space of <small>TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS</small>. It is
of no moment to inquire, on what principles
of his art the learned augur proceeded, in this
calculation. The <small>TRUTH</small> is, that the event corresponded,
in a surprising manner, to the conjecture;
and that the <i>majesty</i> of the Western
empire (of which Rome was the capital) <i>did</i>,
indeed, expire under the merciless hands of
the Goths, about the time limited by this augural
prophet.</p>

<p>It should further, be observed that this prediction
was of such credit and notoriety, as to
take the attention of the later Romans themselves<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>,
who looked with anxiety for the accomplishment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of it: and that it was delivered
by Valens, at least <i>five hundred years</i> before
the event; when there was not the least appearance,
that this catastrophe would befall, what
was called, the <small>ETERNAL CITY</small>, within that
period.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is an instance of divination from <i>augury</i>.
The <small>OTHER</small>, I am about to give, is a
<i>prophecy</i>, in full form; respecting a still more
important subject, and equally accomplished
in the event. A poet, in the ideas of paganism,
was a prophet, too. And Seneca<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> hath left us,
in proof of the inspiration to which, in his
double capacity, he might pretend, the following
oracle:</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">&mdash;&mdash;venient annis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secula seris, quibus Oceanus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vincula rerum laxet, et ingens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pateat tellus, Tiphysque novos<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
<span class="i0">Detegat orbes; nec sit terris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ultima Thule.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This prediction was made in the reign of
Nero; and, for more than <i>fourteen hundred</i>
years, might only pass for one of those sallies
of imagination, in which poetry so much delights.
But, when, at length, in the close of
the <i>fifteenth</i> century, the discoveries of Columbus
had realized this vision: when that
enterprizing navigator had forced the barriers
of the vast Atlantic ocean; had <i>loosened</i>, what
the poet calls, <i>the chain of things</i>; and in
these <i>later ages</i><a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, as was expressly signified,
had set at liberty an immense continent, shut
up before in surrounding seas from the commerce
and acquaintance of our world; when
this event, I say, so important and so unexpected,
came to pass, it might almost surprize
one into the belief, that the prediction was
something more than a poetical fancy; and
that Heaven had, indeed, revealed to <i>one</i> favoured
Spaniard, what it had decreed, in due
time, to accomplish under the auspices of
<i>another</i><a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> two instances of casual conjecture,
converted by time and accident into prophecies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
I shall take for granted, are as remarkable,
as any other that can be alledged. Cicero,
in his first book of <i>Divination</i>, where he
laboured to assert the reality of such a power
in the pagan world, was able to produce nothing
equal, or comparable to them. We
have the fullest evidence, that these two predictions
were delivered by the persons, to
whom they are ascribed; and in the time, in
which they are said to have been delivered,
that is, many hundred years before the event.
They, both of them, respect events of the
greatest dignity and importance: one of them,
the downfal of the <i>mightiest empire</i>, that hath
hitherto subsisted on the face of the earth;
and the other, the discovery of a <i>new world</i>.
Both, express the <i>time</i>, when these extraordinary
events were to happen: the <i>latter</i>, by
a general description, indeed, yet not more
general, than is frequent in the scriptural prophets;
but the <i>former</i>, in the most precise
and limited terms. In a word, both these predictions
are authentic, important, circumstantial:
they foretell events, which no human sagacity
could have foreseen; and they have
been strictly and properly fulfilled.</p>

<p>Now, if such coincidencies, as these, do not
infer divine inspiration; if, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
all appearances to the contrary, it must still be
allowed (as it will, on all sides) that they were
simply <i>fortuitous</i>, or what we call the effects
of hazard and pure chance, by what characters
shall we distinguish genuine, from pretended,
prophecies; or in what way shall it be discovered,
that the scriptural prophets spake by the
spirit of <i>God</i>, when these pagan diviners could
thus prophecy, by their <i>own</i> spirit?</p>

<p>To this objection, put with all the force
which I am able to give to it, I reply directly,
That the distinction, so importunately demanded,
may very easily and clearly be assigned.</p>

<p>If <i>one or two</i> such prophecies, <i>only</i>, had occurred
in our scriptures; if even <i>several</i> such
had occurred in the whole extent of those writings,
and in the large compass of time they
take up, without descending to a greater detail
than is expressed in these pagan oracles; nay,
if <i>a greater number still</i> of supposed predictions,
thus generally delivered in the sacred
writings, had been applicable only to single
independent events, dispersed indifferently
through the several ages of the world: In all
these cases, I should freely admit, that the argument
from prophecy was very precarious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
and unsatisfactory: I could even suppose, with
the deriders of this argument, that so many,
and such prophecies, so directed, might not
improbably be accounted for, from some odd
conjuncture of circumstances; and that the accomplishment
of them did by no means infer a
certainty of inspiration.</p>

<p>But, if now, on the other hand, it be indisputable,
That a vast variety of predictions are
to be found in the scriptures of the Old and
New Testament; That a great part of these
predictions are delivered with the utmost degree
of minuteness and particularity; and,
lastly, That <i>all</i> of them, whether general or
particular, respect one common subject, and
profess to have, or to expect, their completion
in one connected scheme of things, and, upon
the matter, in one single person: On this latter
supposition, I must still think, that there
is great reason to admit the divine inspiration
of such prophecies, when seen to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>To convert this supposition into a <i>proof</i>, is
not within the scope and purpose of this Lecture.
The work hath been undertaken and
discharged by many others: or, it may be sufficient,
in so clear a point, to refer you directly
to the Scriptures themselves; which no man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
can read without seeing, that the prophecies,
contained in them, are extremely numerous&mdash;that
many of these prophecies are minutely
circumstantial&mdash;and that one person, whoever
he be, is the principal object of them all. My
concern, at present, is only to shew, that, if
the supposition itself be well founded, the <i>inference</i>,
just now mentioned, is rightly made.</p>

<p>1. First, then, if the prophecies in the Old
and New Testament be very numerous, and if
those prophecies, so many of them, I mean,
as are alledged in this controversy with unbelievers,
have had a reasonable completion (and
I have a right to make this last supposition,
when the question is concerning the <i>account</i> to
be given of such a fact): If, I say, we argue
from these two assumptions, it must appear
highly credible and probable, that so numerous
prophecies, so fulfilled, had not their origin
from human conjecture, nor their accomplishment
from what we call, <i>Chance</i>. For mere
conjecture is not usually so happy; nor chance,
so constant<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>. Further still; if the scriptural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
prophecies have been completed in numerous
instances, and if in <i>no</i> instance whatsoever can
it be clearly shewn that they have failed in the
event, the presumption is still stronger, that
such coincidence could not be fortuitous; and
a material difference between scriptural prophecy,
and pagan divination is, at the same
time, pointed out. For, that, in the multitude
of pretended oracles in the days of paganism,
some few only should come to pass,
while the generality of them fell to the ground,
may well be the sport of <i>fortune</i><a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>. But, that
very many prophecies, recorded in our scriptures,
have had an evident completion, when
not <i>one</i> of all those, there recorded, can be
convicted of imposture, must surely be the
work of <i>design</i>.</p>

<p>The argument cannot be denied to have real
weight, though the expression of <i>all</i> the prophecies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
were allowed to be <i>general</i>. But this
is, by no means, the case. It is further assumed,
and is evident to all that have read the
Scriptures, that a great number of them are
delivered with the utmost degree of minuteness
and particularity. And, from this assumption,
I infer,</p>

<p>2. Secondly, that the accomplishment of
prophecies, so circumstantially defined, can
still less be imputed to mere chance.</p>

<p>Without doubt, if all the prophecies concerning
the Messiah had been penned in the
style of the first&mdash;<i>that the seed of the woman
should bruise the serpent’s head</i>&mdash;though even
then there might be reason for applying them,
exclusively, to the person of Christ, yet, the
evidence, that they were intended to be so applied,
would have been much obscured by the
mode of expression; the wide cover of which
might seem to afford room for other applications.
But when, to this general prophecy,
the theme of all succeeding ones, it is further
added, That this seed of the woman, should
be the seed of Abraham; of the tribe of Juda;
of the family of David; that he should be born
at Bethlehem; that he should appear in the
world at a time, limited by certain events, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
even precisely determined to a certain period:&mdash;when,
after a particular description of his
life and office, it is said of him, that he should
be betrayed by an intimate friend; and sold
for a price, exactly specified; that he should
suffer a particular kind of death; should have
his hands and feet pierced; should have vinegar
given him to drink; and should be buried
in the sepulchre of a rich man&mdash;with innumerable
other particularities of the like nature<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>&mdash;When
all this, I say, is considered; the
improbability, that these <i>specific</i> characters
should meet in the same person by <i>chance</i>, is
so great, that a reasonable man will scarce
venture on so hazardous a position.</p>

<p>3. Still this is not all. Were we at liberty
to apply even <i>numerous, and circumstantial</i>
prophecies, to <i>any</i> person, indifferently, whom
they might suit, and to <i>any</i> events indiscriminately,
to which they might correspond,
sought out at large in the history of mankind,
the force of the argument for <i>design</i> in such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
prophecies, might in good measure be eluded.
But, when we reflect on what, in part, hath
appeared under the last article, that all the
scriptural predictions profess to respect one
certain scheme of things; run in the line of
one people; and point ultimately at one person,
whose country, and family, and age, and
birth-place are exactly defined; the application
of them is so limited and restrained, that,
if they suit at all, there is scarce a possibility of
excluding actual foresight, and intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let me</span>, further, observe, that, as, upon this
idea of a confined, connected, and dependent
scheme, in the prophecies, the detection of
imposture, if there be any, is much facilitated;
so, on the other hand, if the prophecies can
be fairly applied in this way, not only the presumption,
that they were given to be so applied,
is much increased, but a clearer insight
into the scope and meaning of them, is obtained.
For, in a system of prophecy, directed
to one and the same general end, preceding
prophecies prepare the way for interpreting
those that follow, and every succeeding
prophecy reflects some light on those that went
before. Thus, the general evidence, arising
from this species of argument, is, in all ways,
augmented; while we see, that less room is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
left to chance in verifying the more clear and
direct prophecies, and that fresh light is let in
upon such as are more ambiguous or obscure.</p>

<p>It is said, that many passages in the prophets
are applied to Jesus, on very slight
grounds. This would be true, if the prophetic
scriptures, like the pagan oracles, had no
determinate scheme in view, and had, for their
object, only detached and unconnected events.
But, on this scriptural principle, that one
common purpose is in the contemplation of
that divine spirit, which dictated all those writings,
That is <i>expressed</i>, which is barely intimated;
and every applicable prophecy is
<i>rightly</i> applied: whence it is, that even secondary
prophecies have, in the system of revelation,
all the light and force of the primary; as,
in a former discourse, hath been observed.</p>

<p>This assertion, I know, may startle such
persons, as have not attended to the genius of
the prophetic writings, or to that general harmony
of design and destination, which makes
their distinctive character: but it may be rendered
familiar to us by reflecting on the <i>manner</i>,
in which we interpret other writings,
somewhat similar to these.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>It is generally supposed, and on good grounds,
that Virgil wrote his &AElig;neid with the view of
doing honour to the person and government of
Augustus. But, the subject of his work being
taken from a former age, this was either to be
done, by introducing his encomiums under the
form of <i>prophecies</i>, or by conveying them indirectly
in allusive descriptions and, what we
call, <i>secondary</i> applications. The poet hath
employed both these methods, with success.
The purpose of his <i>predictions</i> is clear; for in
them the emperor is expressly named: and
the ablest critics make no scruple of applying
to Augustus all those passages in this poem,
which, however they may respect, immediately,
other persons, are yet clearly seen to be
<i>applicable</i> to Him.</p>

<p>We have another instance of the same sort,
at home. Our Spenser wrote his famous poem,
to illustrate the virtues and reign of Queen
Elizabeth. This we know from himself.
Though his scene, therefore, be laid in <i>Faery
Land</i>, yet, whenever we find his fictions agreeing
to the history of that princess, or the characters
of his knights expressive of those virtues,
which distinguished the great persons of
her court, we make no doubt of applying them
in that way, or of the poet’s intending that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
they should be so applied. These applications
would not be equally justifiable in <i>other</i> works
of fancy, written in that time; but the knowledge,
we have of the author’s general purpose
in writing, makes them reasonable in <i>this</i>.</p>

<p>It may appear from these examples<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>, that,
whenever a general scheme is known to be pursued
by a writer, whose real or assumed character
gives him a right to deal in secondary
senses and prophetic anticipations, that scheme
becomes the true key, in the hands of his reader,
for unlocking the meaning of particular
parts; of many parts, which would otherwise
not be seen clearly and distinctly to refer to
such scheme. The observation applies to the
inspired writers, in all its force. We understand,
that they had one common and predominant
scheme in view, which was <i>to bear testimony
to Jesus</i>. Their writings are, then, to
be interpreted in conformity to that scheme.
Not only the more direct prophecies require
this interpretation; but, if we will judge in
this, as we do in other similar instances, whatever
passages occur in those writings, which
bear an apt and easy resemblance to the history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of Jesus, may, or rather <i>must</i>, in all reasonable
construction, be applied to him.</p>

<p>Whence we see (to mention it by the way)
that, if no prophecy in the Old Testament had
applied to Christ directly in its <i>primary</i> sense,
Christianity might, yet, support itself on the
evidence of prophecy. For the evidence, arising
from a <i>secondary</i> sense of prophecies, is
<i>real</i> evidence; and was certainly admitted, as
such, by that great man<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>, whose mistakes on
this subject have afforded the occasion of so
much vain triumph to infidelity.</p>

<p>Fancy, no doubt, may grow wanton in this
sort of applications. It may find, in the prophet
or poet, what was never designed by either:
but, in the circumstances supposed, the
severest reader will not deny, that <i>much</i> was
probably designed by both. It is impossible
to lay down general rules, that shall prevent
all abuse in the interpretation of such writings.
But good sense will easily see, in particular
cases, where this liberty of interpreting is, in
<i>fact</i>, abused.</p>

<p>It is obvious to remark, that this use of prophecy
doth not commence, till the corresponding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
facts can be produced; that is, till the
prophecies are seen to be fulfilled. But this
circumstance is no discredit to the prophetic
system; which pretends not to give immediate
conviction, but to lay in, beforehand, the
<i>means</i> of conviction to such as shall be in a
condition to compare, in due time, the prediction
with the event. Till then, prophecy
serves only to raise a general expectation of the
event predicted; that is, it serves to make
men attentive and inquisitive, and to prepare
them for that full conviction, which it finally
hath in view. And this service, the prophecies
of the Old Testament actually did the
Jews, who were led by them to expect the
Messiah, when he, in fact, appeared among
them. And, had they pursued this reasonable
method of interpreting the prophecies, not by
their prejudices, but by corresponding events,
they must have been further led to acknowledge
his mission, as being evidently attested
by predictions, so fulfilled. But their capital
mistake lay in supposing, that their prophecies
were sufficiently clear, without the help of any
comment from succeeding events; and thus,
what they <i>could not</i> see beforehand, they <i>would
not</i> acknowledge, when these events came to
pass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>It follows from what hath been said, that
the obscurity of the Jewish prophecies concludes
nothing against the <i>use</i> of those writings,
or against the <i>application</i> of them, which
Christians now make. Their <i>declared</i> use is
posterior to the facts they adumbrate; whence
the intervening obscurity of those writings is
no just ground of complaint: and the <i>application</i>
of them to Jesus, now that history hath
taught us to understand them better, is made
on principles to which no sober man can object.</p>

<p>On the whole, the general evidence for the
truth of Christianity, as resulting from the
scriptural prophecies, though possibly not <i>that</i>
which some may wish or expect, is yet apparently
very considerable. <i>Some</i> coincidencies
might fall out, by accident; and <i>more</i>, might
be imagined. But when <i>so many</i>, and <i>such</i>
prophecies are brought together, and compared
with their corresponding events, it becomes
ridiculous (because the effect is, in no degree,
proportioned to the cause) to say of such coincidencies,
that they are the creatures of <i>fancy</i>
or could have been the work of <i>chance</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span></p>

<p>The text supplies the only just account of
such a ph&aelig;nomenon: and the spirit of God,
methinks, calls aloud to us, in the language
of his Son&mdash;<i>These things have I told you before
they come, that when they come to pass,
ye may believe, that I am <span class="smcap">He</span>.</i>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">The</span> preceding discourses were designed, to
open the <i>general idea</i> of prophecy; and to enforce
the <i>general argument</i> from it, in proof
of our holy Religion.</p>

<p>The way being thus far cleared, we now advance
a step farther, and take a nearer view of
<small>THE PROPHECIES THEMSELVES</small>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span></p>

<p>These prophecies may be considered under
<i>two</i> heads. They either respect, <i>the person
and character and office of the Messiah</i>; or,
<i>the fate and fortunes of that kingdom</i>, which
he came to establish in the world.</p>

<p>Divines call the <i>former</i> of these, Prophecies
of his <small>FIRST COMING</small>: and the <i>other</i>, Prophecies
of his <small>SECOND</small>. Only, it may be proper
to observe, That the <i>second</i> advent of the Messiah
is not, like the <i>first</i>, confined to one single
and precise period, but is gradual and successive.
This distinction is founded in the reason
of the thing. He could only come, <i>in
person</i>, at one limited time. He comes, <i>in
his power and his providence</i>, through all ages
of the church. His <i>first</i> coming was then
over, when he expired on the cross. His <i>second</i>,
commenced with his resurrection, and
will continue to the end of the world. So that
this <i>last</i> coming of Jesus is to be understood of
his <i>spiritual kingdom</i>; which is not one act
of sovereignty, exerted at once; but a state or
constitution of government, subsisting through
a long tract of time, unfolding itself by just
degrees, and <i>coming</i>, as oft, as the conductor
of it thinks fit to interpose by any signal acts
of his administration. And in this sense, we
are directed to pray, <i>that his kingdom</i>, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
long since set up, <i>may come</i>; that is, may advance
through all its stages, till it arrive at that
full state of glory, in which it shall shine out
in <i>the great day</i>, as it is called, the day of
judgment.</p>

<p>It will be seen, as we advance in the present
inquiry, to what use this distinction serves.</p>

<p>The <i>former</i> set of prophecies are presumed
to have had their completion, in the history of
<i>Jesus</i>; The <i>latter</i> set, have had, or are to
find, their accomplishment, in the history of
his <i>Religion</i>; And of <small>THESE</small> only, it is the
purpose of this Lecture to speak.</p>

<p>But, though the prophecies of Christ’s <i>first</i>
coming (so largely and accurately considered
by many great writers) be not the immediate
subject of our inquiry, yet they must
not be wholly overlooked by us. It will contribute
very much to rectify and enlarge our
ideas of the divine conduct, in this whole dispensation
of prophecy, and to make way for
that conviction, which the prophecies of
Christ’s <i>second</i> coming were intended to give,
if we stop a while to contemplate the <i>method
and œconomy</i> of that prophetic system, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
which the <i>first</i> advent of the Messiah was announced
and prepared.</p>

<p>It is assumed, as a first principle on this
subject, <i>That Jesus was the ultimate end and
object of all the prophecies</i><a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>: which beginning
from the foundation of the world<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>, were, afterwards,
occasionally delivered through many
ages; till at length this great purpose was prosecuted
more intently, by a continued and
closely-compacted chain of prophecy; as we
see, first, in the patriarchal history, but, chiefly,
in the history of the Jewish state. For, when
this people were selected from the other nations,
to answer many wise ends of providence,
it pleased God to institute a form of government
for them, which could not subsist without
his frequent interposition; manifested in
such a way as might convince them, that they
were under the actual and immediate conduct
of their divine sovereign. Hence, it became a
part of this singular œconomy, to be administered
in the way of <i>Prophecy</i>; by which it
would be seen that the hand of God was upon
them in all their more important concerns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>Upon this basis of an <i>extraordinary providence</i>,
the Jewish government stood: and we
are now to see in what <i>manner</i> the prophetic
spirit, so essential to that polity, was employed.</p>

<p>1. First, we may observe, that, by means
of this provision for their civil regimen, an apt
and commodious way was opened for carrying
on the divine councils, in regard to <i>Jesus</i>; in
whom, indeed, the Law itself was to be fulfilled.
For, while the civil affairs of the Jewish
people furnished the occasion and substance of
their prophecies, the divine wisdom, that inspired
the prophets, so contrived, as that their
religious concerns should, also, be expressed,
or implied in them. The general theme of the
<i>prophet</i>, was some, temporal success or calamity
of the Jewish state: the secret purpose of the
<i>inspirer</i> was, occasionally at least, and when he
saw fit, to predict the spiritual kingdom of the
Messiah<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>We have innumerable instances of this sort
in the Jewish prophets; but few, more remarkable
than that of Isaiah’s prophecy, addressed
to Ahaz, king of Judah, concerning
his deliverance from the two kings of Samaria
and Damascus. In the <i>primary</i>, but lower
sense of this prophecy, the sign given was to
assure Ahaz, that the land of Jud&aelig;a should
<i>speedily</i> be delivered from its two Royal invaders.
But it had likewise <i>another</i>, and
more important purpose. The introduction of
the prophecy, the singular stress laid upon it,
and the exact sense of the terms in which it is
expressed, make it probable, in a high degree,
that it had some such purpose: and the event
hath clearly proved, that the <i>sign given</i> had a
respect to the miraculous birth of Christ, and
to a deliverance much more momentous than
that of Ahaz from his present distressful situation&mdash;<i>Hear
ye now</i>, <span class="smcap">O house of David</span>&mdash;<i>The
Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold,
a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son,
and shall call his name Immanuel</i>. <i>Isaiah</i>,
vii. 13, 14. Admit that these words are capable
of being explained, in some sort, of the
<i>child</i> now given to be a sign, to the King of
Jud&aelig;a, of his deliverance within two or three
years, as expressed in the following verses;
still, who sees not that terms so emphatical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
and energetic are more <i>properly</i> understood of
<i>another</i> child, to whose birth and character they
are found, in the event, to be exactly suited?
And, if more properly, who can doubt that
these terms are <i>naturally</i>, that is, reasonably
understood of that other child, when we consider
with what ideas the mind of the prophet
was stored, and what the ultimate end and object
was, by supposition, of the prophet’s inspiration?
The child promised was a <i>sign</i> to
Ahaz of his deliverance; yet a sign too, that
is, a <i>type</i>, to the house of David, of another
deliverance, which they expected, which their
prophets had frequently foretold, and which
we have here announced in the <i>name</i> of this
miraculous child, <span class="smcap">Immanuel</span>, or eminently,
<i>The Deliverer</i>.</p>

<p>There is nothing in this <i>sign</i><a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>, thus interpreted,
but what is easy and unforced; I mean,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
if we bear in mind the genius and character of
the Jewish prophecies. The former event,
signified in the prophecy, was merely <i>civil</i>:
the latter, concerned the <i>spiritual</i> kingdom of
Christ. They were both predicted together:
and the preceding event, when it came to pass,
was, further, to induce an <i>expectation</i>, that the
other event would, in due time, follow. For</p>

<p>2. Secondly, it appears, that, to excite attention
to these <small>SPIRITUAL</small> predictions, more
obscure than the other, and regarding events
more remote, care was taken to secure the authority
of the prophet, by the completion of
his <i>civil</i> predictions in events, distinctly described,
and near at hand. Thus, Moses might
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
be believed by the Jews in what he said, <i>of a
prophet to be raised up</i>, in a future age, <i>like
to himself</i>; when they saw his prophetic blessings
and curses upon them, according to their
deserts in the land of Canaan, so speedily and
so punctually executed. Thus, too, their prophet,
Isaiah, might reasonably expect to find
credit with them, for the glorious things predicted
by him of the great deliverer, the Messiah;
when their deliverance from the Babylonish
captivity was seen so certainly to verify
his prediction of that event. The prophet himself
exults in this argument, as decisive and
unanswerable. <i>Behold</i>, says he, in the text,
<i>the former things are come to pass</i>, i. e. the
prophecies, I have delivered to you concerning
your redemption from the Assyrian bondage,
will soon be so exactly completed, that I regard
them as things <i>past; and therefore new
things do I declare</i>; hence I claim your belief
of other prophecies, concerning a much greater
redemption, to take place hereafter, though
there be no appearance, as yet, of any causes
tending to produce it, <i>for before they spring
forth, I tell you of them</i>. And this appears
to be the general method of <i>all</i> God’s prophets.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>3. With these <i>new things</i>, these Spiritual
prophecies concerning the <i>first</i> coming of the
Messiah, were likewise intermixed other prophecies,
which ran out beyond that term, and
prefigured the great events of his <small>SECOND</small> coming:
and the warrant for admitting <i>these</i>,
would be the completion of those other prophecies,
in the person and sufferings of Christ<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>.
That there are such prophecies in the Old
Testament, will be shewn hereafter. In the
mean time, it will not be thought incredible,
that, if Jesus be indeed the end of the prophetic
scheme, the revolutions of his <i>government</i>
should be foretold, as well as the circumstances
of his personal appearance; in other words,
that the consummation of that design, which
Providence was carrying on, would not be
overlooked, when the steps and gradations of
it were so distinctly noted. For, in any reasonable
design whatsoever, the <i>end</i> is first and
principally in view, though the <i>means</i> engage,
and may seem to engross, the attention of its
author. It will then, I say, be no surprise to
us to find, that prophecy set out with announcing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the kingdom of the Messiah; that it never
lost sight of that future œconomy; and only
produced it into clearer view, as the season approached
for the introduction of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus much</span> concerning the <i>order and method</i>
of the Jewish prophecies; in which one
cannot but adore the profound wisdom of their
author. The <i>civil</i> prophecies are, at once, the
vehicle, and the credentials, of the <i>spiritual</i>,
concerning the <i>first</i> coming of Jesus; and
these last, in their turn, support the credit of
others, which point still further at his <i>second</i>
coming: a subject, more than intimated by
the <i>legal</i> prophets, but resumed and amply
displayed by the <i>evangelical</i>. Whence we
see, that the prophetic system is so constructed,
as, in the progress and various evolutions of
it, to illustrate itself, and to afford an internal
evidence of its divinity. One great purpose
pervades the whole: and the parts, of which
it consists, gradually prepare and mutually
sustain each other.</p>

<p>But this subject, so curious and important,
is not yet to be dismissed. It remains to be
considered, whether <i>chance</i>, or <i>imposture</i>, can
in any degree account for so extensive, so connected,
and so intricate a system.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<p>On the very face of the prophetic scriptures
it appears, that one ultimate purpose is in the
contemplation of all the prophets. This purpose
is unfolded by successive predictions, delivered
in distant times, under different circumstances,
and by persons, who cannot be
suspected of acting in concert with each other.
It does not appear, that the later prophets always
understood the drift of the more ancient;
or, that either of them clearly apprehended the
whole scope and purpose of their own predictions.
Yet, on comparing all their numerous
prophecies with each other, and with the
events, in which it is now presumed they have
had their completion, we find a perfect harmony
and consistency between them. Nothing
is advanced by one prophet, that is contradicted
by another. An unity of design is
conspicuous in them all; yet without the least
appearance of <i>collusion</i>, since <i>each</i> prophet
hath his own peculiar views, and enlarges on
facts and circumstances, unnoticed by any
other.</p>

<p>Further still, these various and successive
prophecies are so intimately blended, and, as
we may say, incorporated with each other,
that the credit of all depends on the truth of
each. For, the accomplishment of them falling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
in different times, every preceding prophecy
becomes surety, as it were, for those
that follow; and the failure of any one must
bring disgrace and ruin on all the rest.</p>

<p>Then, again, consider that the prophetic
spirit, which kept operating so uniformly and
perpetually in what is called the <i>former age</i>,
ceased at that very time, when the great object,
it had in view, was disclosed; when that
future œconomy, which it first and last predicted,
was introduced: a <i>time</i>, too, which
was precisely determined by the old prophets
themselves. Could they answer for what <i>design</i>
or <i>chance</i> might be able to bring about?
Is it credible, that this perennial fount of prophecy,
which ran so copiously from Adam to
Christ, and watered all the ages of the Jewish
church, should stop, at once, in so critical a
season; and should never flow again in any
future age; if fortune, or fraud, or fanaticism,
had dispensed its streams, if any thing indeed,
but the hand of God, had opened its source,
and directed its current?</p>

<p>Nor let it be objected that a succession of
prophets was <i>interrupted</i> for some ages before
the coming of Christ. It was so: but not, till
preceding prophets had marked out the precise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
<i>time</i> of his coming<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>; not, till Malachi, with
whom the word of prophecy ceased for a time,
had foretold that this interrupted series should
be resumed and finally closed by Elijah, the
last Jewish prophet and <i>precursor</i> of the Messiah<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>;
and not, till it had been expressly declared,
that this eclipsed light of prophecy
should break forth again with redoubled lustre,
in the <i>days</i> of the Messiah<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>. Who would not
conclude, then, from this very intermission,
that prophecy was given, or withheld, as the
wisdom of God ordained, and not as the caprice
or policy of man directed?</p>

<p>It may not be pretended, that the age, in
which prophecy finally ceased among the Jews,
will account for the suppression of this faculty,
“for that it was an age of the greatest turbulency
and disorder, and that their ruin and
dispersion soon after followed.” This pretence,
I say, is altogether frivolous. For it was precisely
in those circumstances, that their ancient
prophets were most numerous, and their inspirations
most abundant. It was during the
calamitous season of their captivities, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
prophetic power had been most signally exercised
among the Jews. And now, when they
were carried captive into all lands, not a single
prophet arose, or hath arisen to this day, either
for their reproof, or consolation<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>.</p>

<p>If it be said, “that the pagan oracles ceased,
too, about the same time; and that the same
cause, namely, the diffused light and knowledge
of the Augustan age, was fatal to both;”
besides, that this diffusion of light, for obvious
reasons, was not likely to affect the Jewish
prophecies, and did not, as we certainly know,
in any degree diminish the credit of them,
with that people, the fact itself, assumed in
the objection, is plainly false. For the pagan
oracles continued for several ages after that of
Augustus; they became less frequent, only, as
Christianity gained ground; and were not
silenced, but among the last struggles of expiring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
paganism<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>. So that if the Jewish prophecies,
like those of the Gentile world, had been
the issue of <i>fraud</i>, or <i>fanaticism</i> (<i>principles</i>,
that operate at all times, and, with redoubled
force and activity, in the dark days of persecution)
one does not see, why they might not
have continued to this day among the bigoted
professors of that religion.</p>

<p>Now, put all these things together, that is,
The long duration of the prophetic system&mdash;the
mutual dependance and close connexion of
its several parts&mdash;the consistency and uniformity
of its views, all terminating in one point&mdash;and
the final suppression of it (as was likewise
foretold) at the very time, when those
views were accomplished; consider, I say, all
this, and see, if there be not something more
than a blind credulity in the advocates for the
divinity of such a system. See, if there be
any instance upon record&mdash;of so numerous
prophecies&mdash;so long continued&mdash;so intimately
related to each other and to one common end&mdash;so
apparently verified&mdash;and so signally concluded.
If there be, I shall not wonder at the
suspense and hesitation of <i>wise men</i>, on this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
subject: but if, on the other hand, no such
thing was ever seen, or heard of, out of the
land of Jud&aelig;a, they must excuse us if we incline
to think their diffidence misplaced, and
their scruples unnecessary, at least, if not disingenuous.</p>

<p>I descend no farther into a detail on the
scriptural prophecies concerning Christ’s <i>first
coming</i>. The immensity of the subject, and
the plan prescribed to me in this Lecture,
equally restrain me from this attempt. <i>Obscurities</i>
there may, and must be, in so vast a
scheme: <i>Objections</i> may, and must occur to
the construction and application of particular
prophecies. But let any serious man take the
Bible into his hands; let him consider, not <i>all</i>
the prophecies in that book, but such as are
more obvious and intelligible; and let him
compare such <i>prophecies</i>, as he must acknowledge,
and may, in part at least, understand,
with the <i>facts</i>, in which he sees their completion,
or so far, as he may think it <i>probable</i>
that they have been completed; and I dare be
confident that such an inquirer will be much
struck with the amount of the evidence from
prophecy, in support of divine revelation. If,
indeed, on this general survey, he find nothing
to affect him, I shall not desire him to push
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
his researches into the more secret and mysterious
prophecies: much less, shall I advise
him to wade through that cloud of smaller difficulties,
in which the ignorant temerity of
some writers, and the <i>obscure diligence</i> of
others, hath involved <i>this</i>, as it easily may any
other, subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To speak plainly</span>, the only consideration,
which to me seems likely to perplex fair and
candid minds, is this&mdash;“That the argument
from prophecy is understood to be addressed
to those, who admit the divinity of the Jewish
scriptures&mdash;that the Jews themselves were
eminently in this situation&mdash;that, besides this
advantage, the Jews were better qualified, than
any others, to interpret their own prophecies;
and to judge of their completion&mdash;and yet,
that these very men neither were, nor are convinced
by this argument.”</p>

<p>Several things are here asserted, which deserve
to be explained. I take them in an inverted
order.</p>

<p>I. It is said, “<i>that the Jews were not, and
are not to this day, convinced by the argument
from prophecy</i>.” This allegation is in part
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
<i>false</i>: for multitudes<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>, from among the Jews,
were, in the apostolic age, converted to Christianity;
and these are well known to have laid
a peculiar stress on this argument. The greater
part of that people, indeed, disbelieved, and
have continued to this day in their infidelity.
But then let it be considered, 1. that we have
an adequate cause of this effect, in the <i>prejudices</i>
of the Jewish nation; <i>prejudices</i>, of
which their whole history evidently convicts
them. 2. That, notwithstanding their rejection
of Jesus, they admit the existence and authority
of those prophecies, which we apply to
him; and that they themselves have constantly
applied these very prophecies to their expected
Messiah: so that the question between us is
only this, Whether they, or we, <i>rightly</i> apply
them. 3. That their perverse obstinacy in refusing
to submit to the evidence of their prophecies,
is itself foretold by their own prophets.</p>

<p>II. But it is further said, “<i>that their authority,
in this controversy, is greater than
ours, for that they must best understand their
own prophecies, and judge best of their completion</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>1. I do not perceive on what ground of reason
this is said. The old prophecies belong
to us, as well as to them; and have been considered
with as much diligence by Christian,
as by Jewish expositors. Their customs, their
history, their traditions, are equally known to
both parties. Their very language hath been
studied by Christians with a care, not inferior to
that which the Jews themselves employ upon
it; with a <i>care</i>, that not unfrequently, in <i>both</i>,
hath degenerated into superstition.</p>

<p>If it be said, “that the <i>ancient</i> Jews, that
is, the Jews in the time of Christ, must have
been better qualified, than we now are, to interpret
the prophecies, the language, they
spoke, being only a dialect of that in which
the prophecies are written,” the answer is already
given, under the last article: to which
we may further add, that Christianity being
much better understood now, than it was then,
the force of the prophetic language concerning
it (if, indeed, the prophecies have any such
thing in view) must be more distinctly apprehended,
in many instances, by Christians at
this day, than it could be by the Jews, even
when they spoke a dialect of the Hebrew language.
So that still I do not see, upon the
whole, what advantage the Jews, whether of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
ancient or modern times, can be thought to
have over us, in explaining the prophetic scriptures.
And then</p>

<p>2. As to the <i>completion</i> of the prophecies,
the same histories are in the hands of both:
and if they do not apply them, as we do the
appeal is open to common sense. Every man
is left at liberty to judge for himself, which
side is best supported in the application of
them. The prejudice might, indeed, be
thought equal on <i>both</i> sides, if it were not decided
by their own scriptures, that no prejudice
of any people upon earth was ever so invincible,
as that of the Jews.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, on both heads, there is a peculiar
presumption, that they, and not we, are misled
by prejudice: It is this: They were led by
their prophecies, as interpreted by themselves,
to expect that they would be completed at the
<i>time</i>, in which, we say, they were completed;
and it was not till after the coming of Christ
that they began to interpret them differently,
and to look out for another completion of them.
Judge then, if they, or we, are likely to have
erred most, through prejudice, in expounding
and applying the prophecies. The natural and
proper sense will be thought to be that, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
which we take them; for that sense occurred
first to themselves, and was, in truth, <i>their</i>
sense, before we adopted it.</p>

<p>When I say&mdash;<i>their sense</i>&mdash;I mean, especially,
in respect to the <i>time</i>, which they had
fixed for the accomplishment of the prophecies
concerning the Messiah: for, as to their giving
a <i>temporal</i> sense to some prophecies, in which
we find a <i>spiritual</i>, that is another matter,
concerning which, as I said, the appeal lies to
every competent and dispassionate inquirer.
In the mean time, it must be thought some
presumption in favour of the Christian interpretation,
that, whereas the <span class="smcap">Jews</span>, in rejecting
a spiritual or mystical sense of those prophecies
(which yet is admitted by them, without
scruple, on other occasions, and is well suited
to the genius of their whole religion) are driven
to the necessity of supposing a <i>two-fold Messias</i>&mdash;a
new conceit, taken up, without warrant
from their scriptures, and against their
own former ideas and expectations&mdash;<span class="smcap">We</span>, on
the contrary, by the help of that spiritual sense,
are able to explain all the prophecies of <i>one
and the same Messias</i>, conformably to the
<i>event</i>, and even to the <i>time</i> which the Jews
themselves had prefixed for the completion of
them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>Now, when, of two interpretations, <i>one</i> has
apparently all the marks of shift, constraint,
and distress in it, and the <i>other</i> comes out
easy, uniform, and consistent; we may guess
beforehand, as I said, which of them is likely
to be well-founded.</p>

<p>III. Still it is pretended, “that the argument
from prophecy is properly addressed to
those only who admit the divinity of the Jewish
scriptures, as the Jews have invariably done;
and that it hath no force, but on that previous
supposition. Why then is the argument pressed
on others, who do not believe the divine authority
of those scriptures? And how should
it prevail with <i>any</i>, whether believers or not,
when the Jews themselves, who of all men
most firmly believe that authority, are not convinced
by it?”</p>

<p>The <i>latter</i> part of the difficulty, which respects
the incredulity of the Jews, hath been
already removed; so far, I mean, as it is
founded on their prejudices. As for the <i>assertion</i>,
“That the argument from prophecy presupposes
the truth and divinity of the Jewish
scriptures, and must therefore have most
weight with the Jews, or rather hath no weight
at all, but with them, or with others, who admit
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
that common principle,” though something,
like this, may have been said, I take it
to be wholly unsupported, as well by <i>fact</i>, as
by any <i>good reason</i>.</p>

<p>1. I argue against this assumption from
<i>fact</i>; that is, from the <i>method</i>, taken by the
early Christians to convert the Gentile world,
and from the <i>success</i> of that method.</p>

<p>If we look into the history of the Gospel, we
shall find the Apostle Peter, pressing this argument
from prophecy on the gentile Cornelius<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>;
and the Apostle Paul, urging it with
effect, on the Jews indeed first, but also on
the Asiatic Gentiles<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>. If we turn to the
Christian apologists, we shall find them addressing
this topic to Gentile unbelievers, nay,
as venturing the whole cause of Christianity on
this single argument<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>. Justin Martyr makes
as free use of it in his apology to the Antonines,
as in his dialogues with Trypho. We know,
too, the success of this argument, thus employed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
in many instances: and therefore see,
as well the <i>fitness</i> of the argument to produce
this effect, as the <i>judgment</i> of the Apostles
and primitive Christians concerning its fitness.
But to come</p>

<p>2. <i>to the reason of the thing</i>.</p>

<p>The Jews, who professed to believe, and
did, in fact, believe, the divine inspiration of
their sacred oracles, were, doubtless, bound
by their own principles, to expect with assurance
the due completion of them. The Gentiles,
who did not previously respect those oracles
as of divine authority, but regarded them
only in the light of human conjectures, yet
saw that such passages, whether we call them
oracular or conjectural, did, in truth, occur in
the Jewish scriptures; and were obliged to admit,
on the faith of historical testimony, that
those scriptures were composed by the persons
whose names they bear, and at the times fixed
for the composition of them. What then is
the difference of the two cases? Only this:
the Jews believed that their oracles would be
fulfilled, because they held them to be divine;
the Gentiles had to wait till those oracles were
fulfilled, before they acknowledged their divinity.
In either case, the argument is independent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
of the belief, or the expectation, and
turns on the completion only. Then, indeed,
the Jew sees that his belief was well founded,
and the Gentile admits that the prediction was
divine.</p>

<p>The mistake would be equal, on the other
hand, to conceive, that the argument from prophecy
pre-supposes the divine inspiration of
the New Testament. It pre-supposes only the
historical truth of that book. Admit this, and
compare the events recorded in that history,
with the prophecies to which they correspond,
and the divinity of both Testaments is proved.
For then, the pretensions of Jesus are made
good, by the <i>completion</i> of the prophecies;
and the inspiration of the prophets is concluded,
from the <i>delivery</i> of them.</p>

<p>In both cases (let me repeat it) it is not the
authority of the books containing the prophecies,
nor of the books recording the facts in
which they are fulfilled, but simply the <i>completion</i>
of the prophecies in those facts, seen
and acknowledged, which infers the divinity
of either Testament. Even the Jew would retract
his high opinion of the prophecies, if he
did not admit or expect the accomplishment of
them; and the Christian would renounce his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
faith in Jesus, if his history did not accord to
the prophecies, alledged.</p>

<p>’Tis true, that, with either, the argument
would gain more <i>attention</i>, than with such as
professed no previous belief in the divinity of
the Old or New Testament. But its force is
really the same, on both suppositions. It lies
merely in the conviction, which one hath from
the evidence produced, that certain prophetic
passages were delivered in the <i>Old</i> Testament,
and have been fulfilled by certain corresponding
events, related in the <i>New</i>.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is no reason to conclude,
that we are not as good judges of the
argument from prophecy, as the Jews were;
or, that this argument ought to have the less
weight with us, because the Jews were not
convinced by it. For the argument doth in
no degree depend on <i>faith</i>, but is calculated
to produce it. It is equally strong, or equally
weak, to a Christian, or Jew, or even to an
unbeliever: the sole point in question being
this, Whether such things, as were prophetically
delivered, appear to have been fulfilled:
a point, on which common sense and common
honesty will equally decide, on every supposition.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>I know, indeed, that, unless we suppose the
inspiration of the prophets, <i>some</i> passages, delivered
by them, will not so probably be
thought to <i>intend</i> Christ, as they will be, if
we acknowledge that principle: and, on the
other hand, that there are <i>some</i> circumstances
in the history of Jesus, which will not be so
readily seen to <i>refer</i> to preceding prophecies,
if the inspiration of Jesus and his Apostles be
not previously admitted. But I do not argue,
at present, from either of these topics. There
are passages enough, clearly <i>predictive</i> of the
Messiah, and clearly <i>accomplished</i> in him, to
afford a solid foundation for the argument
from prophecy, as here instituted, without
looking out for any other of more nice and ambiguous
interpretation.</p>

<p>Hence we see the dangerous mistake of
those, who contend that the argument from
prophecy hath not, of itself, the nature of a
<i>direct positive proof</i> of our religion. Prophecies
fulfilled, I mean such prophecies as <i>those</i>
in question, prove invincibly the divine inspiration
of the prophets. But, if the prophets
were inspired, the divine mission of him, in
whom the predicted marks of the Messiah meet,
must needs be acknowledged. And what more
is required to prove the truth of Christianity?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Not even the evidence of <i>miracles</i>, performed
by Christ, if the prophecies had not made
them one mark of his character. The truth is,
<i>Prophecies</i> and <i>Miracles</i> are, in themselves,
two distinct positive proofs. Either proof is
<i>direct</i>, and would have been sufficient, if the
other had not been given. But the divine goodness,
for our more abundant satisfaction, and
to leave infidelity without excuse, hath made
the one proof dependent on the other: so
that neither the argument from prophecy is
complete, without the <i>miracles</i>; nor the argument
from miracles, as applied to Christ, unless
he likewise appear to have fulfilled the <i>prophecies</i>.
Can we desire a stronger proof, that
neither <i>they</i>, who predicted the <i>miracles</i>, were
<i>false prophets</i>, nor <i>he</i>, who claimed to himself
the application of <small>ALL</small> the <i>prophecies</i>, was
a <i>false Messiah</i>?</p>

<p>These reflexions, on the <i>method and order</i>
of the prophecies, of those especially concerning
Christ’s <small>FIRST COMING</small>; together with what
has been said on the <i>independency</i> of this argument
on Jewish or Christian concessions;
may serve to convince us, That we shall do
well to suspend our conclusions concerning the
evidence of prophecy, till we have examined
the <i>whole</i> subject. In the mean time, <i>this</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
<i>part</i> of the subject, thus far opened and explained,
leads us, with advantage, to the consideration
of <i>that</i>, which is yet behind and is
the peculiar object of this Lecture, I mean
<i>the prophecies concerning</i> <span class="smcap">Christ’s second
coming</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<h2 id="SERMON_VI">SERMON VI.<br />

<span class="large">PROPHECIES CONCERNING
CHRIST’S SECOND COMING.</span><br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">Isaiah</span> xlii. 9.</span></h2>

<p class="hang"><i>Behold, the former things are come to pass,
and new things do I declare: before they
spring forth, I tell you of them.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> must strike the most careless reader of the
prophecies to observe, that the general subject
of them all was announced from the earliest
time, and was only drawn out more distinctly
by succeeding prophets: that, of the two <i>ages</i>,
into which the world of God, I mean his <i>religious</i>
world, is divided in holy scripture, the
<i>former</i>, which abounds most in prophecy, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
plainly made subservient to the <i>latter</i>: that
not only the events of that preceding age are
foretold by its own prophets, but that the fortunes
of the last, and very remote age, are occasionally
revealed by them; and that the same
oracles, which attest the <i>first coming</i> of Christ,
as if impatient to be confined to so narrow
bounds, overflow, as it were, into the future
age, and expatiate on the principal facts and
circumstances of his <i>second coming</i>.</p>

<p>By this divine artifice, if I may so speak,
the two dispensations, the Jewish and Christian,
are closely tied together, or rather compacted
into one intire harmonious system;
such, as we might expect, if it were indeed
formed, and conducted by him, <i>to whom are
known all his works from the beginning</i><a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>.</p>

<p>So that, in respect of the fortunes, which
were to befall the Christian church, even in
the <i>latter days</i>, we may still ask, in the triumphant
terms of the Jewish prophet&mdash;<i>Have
ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath
it not been told you from the beginning?
Have ye not understood from the foundation
of the earth<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>?</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>But, though this subject was opened by the
old prophets, so far as seemed expedient in
that <i>age</i>, and clearly enough, to shew the integrity
and continuity of the whole system, it
was more illustriously, because more distinctly,
displayed by the evangelical prophets.</p>

<p>And here, again, the same provision of wisdom
and goodness meets us, as before. The
Christian prophets, like the Jewish, bespeak
our attention to what they reveal of the greater
and more distant events in their dispensation,
by other less momentous prophecies, which
were speedily to be accomplished<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>; thus, impressing
upon us an awful sense of their divine
foresight, and procuring an easy credit from us
to their subsequent predictions: <i>while the
events, which both these prophetic schemes
point out, are so distributed through all time,
as to furnish, successively, to the several ages
of the world, the means of a fresh and still
growing conviction</i><a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As the order</span> of these Discourses, now,
leads me to exemplify this <i>last</i> observation, I
shall do it in <small>THREE</small> remarkable prophecies
concerning the Christian church; I mean
those, which respect 1. <span class="smcap">The destruction of
Jerusalem.</span> 2. <span class="smcap">The dispersion of the
Jews.</span> And 3. <span class="smcap">The conversion of the Gentiles.</span></p>

<p>I refer to these prophecies, as well known.
They are in the number of those, which, in
part, were delivered by the Jewish prophets;
and afterwards, more distinctly revealed by
the Christian.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The destruction of the Jewish city
and temple</span>, is an event of the utmost moment
in the view of revealed religion. It accomplished
a great number of prophecies, and
vindicated the honour of Jesus, by a signal
vengeance on his murderers. It answered, besides,
<i>other</i> important purposes of divine providence;
by putting a visible and necessary
end to the Jewish œconomy, which was now
to give way to the dispensation of the Messiah;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
and by dispersing the Jews into all lands, for
many wise and admirable reasons. Hence, of
all the prophecies, delivered by Christ himself
(who was a prophet, though indeed <i>much more
than a prophet</i>) <i>This</i> alone is displayed by
him, at large, and in all its circumstances.</p>

<p>If any man, unacquainted with these matters,
should doubt, whether this prophecy of
Jesus, as recorded in three of the four Gospels,
were not delivered, that is, <i>forged</i>, after the
event, I might refer him to the numerous
writers on that subject. But I hold it sufficient
to say, 1, On the faith of all antiquity,
that these Gospels were not only written, but
published to the world, before the destruction
of Jerusalem&mdash;2, that the early date of their
composition is apparent from many internal
characters, dispersed through these writings&mdash;3,
that no interpolation of this prophecy could
afterwards take place, because the prophecy is
interwoven with the general thread of the
history&mdash;and, 4, lastly, that no unbeliever of
the primitive times, whether Jew or Gentile,
when pressed, as both frequently were, by this
prophecy, appears to have had recourse to the
charge, either of forgery, or interpolation<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>The authenticity and early date of the prophecy
is, then, on these grounds, assumed.</p>

<p>I will, further, suppose (because the history
of Josephus invincibly proves it) that all the
particulars, mentioned in this prophecy, concurred
in the <i>event</i>.</p>

<p>“But this, you will say, might well be: for
what more <i>uniform</i>, than the characters of
distress in a <i>great</i> city, forced and desolated
by a superior enemy? And what more <i>probable</i>,
than that, some time or other, such should
be the fate of <i>every</i> great city?”</p>

<p>It may further be insinuated, “That, if ever
Jerusalem was to be destroyed, the obstinate
humour of its inhabitants, and the <i>nature of
the place</i>, would probably draw this destruction
upon it, in the way it actually happened,
in the way of <i>siege</i><a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>: that, then, all the miseries,
endured by the Jews, would naturally
fall on a desperate people from an irritated and
successful conqueror; above all, in ancient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
times, when conquest and clemency were little
acquainted with each other: that, as for the
preceding <i>wars, famines, pestilences, and earth-quakes</i>
(which are mentioned, in the prophecy,
as <i>signs</i> of the approaching desolation) <i>these</i>,
are such usual things in the course of the
world, as may be safely made the prognostics
of any predicted event whatsoever: that Jesus,
therefore, as any other wise man, might form
his prediction on these principles; and trust
to time, and the passions of mankind, for the
completion of it.”</p>

<p>Now, let all this be allowed (and scepticism
itself will hardly make other or greater demands
upon us) still, the honour of Jesus
stands secure; and this fine fabric of suspicion
is overturned at once, if we reflect on <i>two or
three</i> circumstances, unluckily, and, if the
prophet be not divine, unnecessarily wrought
into the texture of this famous prophecy.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, I observe, that this destruction was
to come from <i>the hands of the Romans</i><a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>; and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
without doubt, if it were to happen in any reasonable
time, it could not so probably be expected
to come from any other quarter. But,
then, was it <i>likely</i> that Jud&aelig;a, at that time a
Roman province, should be thus isolated by
its own masters? Was it to be <i>presumed</i>, that
so small a province should dare to engage in a
formal contest with Rome, the mistress of the
world, as well as of Jud&aelig;a? with Rome, then
the zenith of her power, and irresistible to
all nations? Was it <i>conceivable</i>, if any future
distraction of that mighty empire should tempt
the Jews to oppose their feeble efforts to its
high fortune, that a vengeance so signal, so
complete, should be taken upon them? that
nothing less than a total <i>extermination</i> should
be proposed, and effected? The ruin of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
temple at Jerusalem was to be so entire, that
<i>one stone should not be left upon another</i>. Allow
for the exaggerated terms of a prophetic
description; still, was it <i>imaginable</i>, that the
Romans should, in any proper sense of the
words, execute this denunciation? Was it
<i>their</i> way, as it was afterwards that of the
Goths, to wage war with <i>stones</i>? Was it a
principle with <i>them</i>, to beat down the <i>pride</i> of
buildings, as well as of <i>men</i><a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>? Would even
their <i>policy</i>, or their <i>pride</i>, have suffered them
to blot out an ancient, a renowned, an illustrious
temple, the chief ornament of their province,
the glory of the East, and the trophy
of their own conquests?</p>

<p>Such an event was very improbable, in contemplation:
and history shews, that it did not
come to pass in any ordinary way. For the
instrument, in the hands of Heaven, of this
exterminating vengeance, was a man, the most
unlikely of all others to inflict it; a man, who by
nature abhorred such extremities; who, in fact,
did his utmost to prevent this dreadful catastrophe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and <i>could not</i> prevent it<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>.&mdash;Still, a
more unmanageable circumstance, than this,
occurs in the prophecy. For,</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, it is implied that <small>ONE</small> of our Lord’s
disciples should survive this desolation<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>: and
it is expressly asserted, that the then <i>subsisting
generation should not pass away, before
all these things were accomplished</i><a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>. They
<small>WERE</small> accomplished, within forty years from
the date of the prophecy, and before the death
of that disciple. The fact is certain and
undeniable: I leave the rest to your own reflexions.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, warning is given in this prophecy
to the disciples of Jesus, to fly from this impending
ruin; and a signal is held out to them,
for that purpose<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>. It is further predicted,
that they should avail themselves of this signal
and so entirely escape the snare, in which the
rest of their countrymen should be taken, that
<i>not a hair of their heads should perish</i><a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
this part of the prophecy was, it seems, completed<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, this prophecy was incumbered with
another strange event, <i>needlessly</i> incumbered
with it, if the whole were an imposture. It is
said, <i>that the Gospel should be preached in all
the world, for a witness unto all nations</i>, before
it should be fulfilled. Was it not enough
to say, that the prophecy should be accomplished
in the time of that generation, and in
the life-time of St. John, without adding so
unlikely a circumstance, as that a general promulgation
of the Gospel, by a few unlettered
and unfriended fishermen, should precede the
accomplishment of it?&mdash;I know, that this
part of the prophecy admits a secondary sense:
but, in the primary sense, it was so far fulfilled,
as to astonish us with the divine foresight
of its author.</p>

<p>I omit other considerations, that might be
alledged. But you see that, setting aside such
particulars in the prophecy, as sceptical men
may think themselves able to draw within the
sphere of <i>human conjecture</i>, there are several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
things expressed in it, so strange to all apprehension,
so unlikely to happen, so impossible
for any natural sagacity to foresee, and yet so
certainly and punctually fulfilled, that nothing
short of <i>divine inspiration</i> can possibly account
for them. The prophecy, in all its parts, is
divine: but in <i>these</i>, its divinity is clear and
incontestable.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">The dispersion of the Jews</span>, is another
event, which deserves your consideration.</p>

<p>Moses himself had predicted this circumstance
of their fortune, in terms of the greatest
energy. He had told them&mdash;<i>that they should
be removed into all the kingdom of the earth,
and that they should be scattered among all
people from one end of the earth even unto the
other</i>&mdash;that, among the nations, into which
they should be driven, <i>they should find no ease,
nor rest, and that they should be only oppressed
and crushed alway</i>&mdash;that they should
<i>become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
by-word among all nations</i>&mdash;and that <i>their
plagues should be wonderful, and of long continuance</i><a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>.
These prophecies had been, to a
certain degree, fulfilled in other parts of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
history: but there was to be a time, when <i>the
wrath of God should come upon them to the
uttermost</i><a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>. This time was now come, when
their city was destroyed, and their land desolated,
by the arms of Titus. Then, as Jesus
prophesied of them, <i>were the days of vengeance,
that all things, which were written,
should be fulfilled</i>: then, were they <i>to be led
away captive into all nations</i>: and thenceforth,
<i>was Jerusalem to be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until</i> <span class="smcap">the times of the Gentiles
should be fulfilled</span><a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>.</p>

<p>Nor say, that this <i>last</i> prophecy is <i>indefinite</i>:
for <i>the times of the Gentiles</i> is a period,
well known in the prophetic writings; a period,
of long duration indeed, as the event hath
shewn; yet a period, marked out by other
prophecies (which may come, in turn, to be
considered in this Lecture) no less distinctly,
than their other captivities had been.</p>

<p>For, to all these predictions there must be
added <i>one</i> more, which expressly asserts the
return of this people, in some future age, from
their long and wretched dispersion: for <i>blindness,
in part</i>, only, <i>hath happened to Israel</i>;
and that again, <i>till the fulness of the Gentiles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
be come in</i><a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>. This, St. Paul terms <i>a mystery</i>:
and yet the ancient prophets had a glimpse of
it, when they foretold, <i>that the Lord would
not make a full end of them</i><a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>, and that a remnant
of them <i>should remain, and should return
in the latter days</i><a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>. Moses himself,
who had denounced such heavy judgements
upon them, and of so <i>long continuance</i>, during
their dispersion, had mingled, with his woes,
this one note of mercy&mdash;<i>And yet for all that,
when they lie in the land of their enemies, I
will not cast them away, neither will I abhor
them, to destroy them</i> <small>UTTERLY</small>, <i>and to break
my covenant with them</i><a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>.</p>

<p>Consider these predictions, and compare
them with the present and past state of this
people for seventeen hundred years; and see,
if there be nothing to take your attention, or,
rather, your astonishment, in the completion
of them.</p>

<p>Why is this dreadful vengeance, <i>singular</i>
in its circumstances, and never yet experienced
by any other people on the face of the earth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
why is this peculiar vengeance executed on the
Jews?&mdash;Or, whatever the <i>cause</i> may be, is
not the <i>fact</i> such as was predicted?</p>

<p>“The predictions, you will say, have the
appearance of being fulfilled. But where is
the wonder, that a people, distinguished by a
<i>singular</i> religion, and above measure <i>addicted</i>
to it, should continue to exist under that distinction,
and should be every where known by
it? That a people, on account of their profession,
more than commonly obnoxious to
the other religious sects, among whom the
earth hath been chiefly parcelled out&mdash;to the
<i>Heathen</i>, for their unconquerable aversion to
idolatry&mdash;to the <i>Christians</i>, for the atrocious
murder of their founder&mdash;to the <i>Mahometans</i>,
for the constant rejection of their prophet&mdash;should
be the scorn and outcast of all three;
and that, being excluded from the only country,
to which they have any attachment, they
should be vagabonds on the earth, and should
disperse themselves indifferently through every
quarter of it, as caprice, or interest, or convenience,
invites them? that, lastly, being thus
distinguished from all men, and thus at enmity
with all, they should never be suffered to
enter into any other civil community, or to
establish a distinct community of their own?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>But the wonder doth not lie, altogether,
where these questions seem to place it. That
the Jews, while they profess themselves such,
should be thus treated, may be natural enough:
but that they should <i>continue</i>, for so many
ages, under such treatment; every where and
always spurned, reviled, oppressed; yet neither
worn out by this usage; nor induced by
it to renounce their offensive profession, and
take refuge in the mass of people among whom
they live; that neither time, nor custom, nor
suffering, should get the better of their bigotry
or patience; but that they should still subsist a
numerous, a distinct, a wretched people, as
they do, to this day&mdash;all this hath something
prodigious in it, which the common principles
of human nature will not easily explain<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>.</p>

<p>We, who admit the divine origin of their religion;
and, adore, with them, the extraordinary
providence, by which their polity was
so long administered and upheld; can, better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
than any others, explain this difficulty. For,
what so likely to produce an invincible attachment
to their Law, as the abundant evidence,
they had of its authority? But neither will
this account of the matter be found satisfactory.
For, as if on purpose to discredit this solution,
their history informs us, That <i>ten</i>, of the
twelve tribes, which originally composed their
nation, did, in fact, disappear under their last
captivity, and were, in a good measure at
least, absorbed in it. If such, then, was the
fate of <i>Israel</i> in its dispersion, within the compass
of not many generations, and yet the relics
of <i>Judah</i> are still preserved in all countries to
this day, what better or other reason can we
assign for this difference of fortune in two
branches of the same people, equally attached
to the same divine Law, than that the <i>former</i>
were left to the natural consequences of a dispersion,
and that the <i>latter</i> were purposely
kept from being affected by them, as the prophecies
had distinctly foretold?</p>

<p>If it be still said, “That there is nothing
more extraordinary in this continuance of the
Jews, under their dispersion, than of other religionists
in like circumstances; of the <i>Christians</i>
for instance, under the Turkish dominion;”
the cases (to say nothing of the difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
in point of <i>time</i>) are, in many respects,
entirely unlike.</p>

<p>The Asiatic <span class="smcap">Christians</span> derive a confidence,
and some degree of protection, from the many
flourishing Christian empires, which subsist in
other quarters of the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span>, can perform all the duties of their religion,
as perfectly in the countries, where
they reside, as in any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span>, have the future hopes of the Gospel,
the proper sanction of their Law, to support
them in all the distresses, to which their Christian
profession may, at present, expose them.
What is it to them, as St. Austin well observed
in a like case, that they suffer for a season in a
strange land; when even in their <i>own</i>, that is,
a Christian country, they are still obliged, by
the principles of their religion, to consider
themselves, <i>as strangers and pilgrims on the
earth</i><a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>The condition of the <span class="smcap">Jews</span>, on the other
hand, is widely different. <span class="smcap">They</span>, profess a religion,
founded on temporal promises, only:
and how miserably these have failed them, the
experience of many ages hath now shewn.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jews</span>, are shut out from the only country
in the world, where the several rites and
ordinances of their religion can be regularly
and <i>lawfully</i> observed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Jews</span>, have, besides, the sensible mortification
of knowing, that all their brethren of
the dispersion are every where in equal distress
with themselves; and that there is not one
Jewish state or sovereignty subsisting on the
face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>It follows, that in the <span class="smcap">Jews</span>, we find nothing
but their <i>destiny</i>, so plainly read to them
by their own prophets, as well as ours, to account
for their long continuance in their present
dispersion: whereas, the <i>Asiatic Christians</i>
have many resources of comfort within
themselves; and may subsist, in Mahometan
countries, on the same general motives and
inducements, which sustain the courage of
other unhappy men.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding the advantages, here
pointed out, on the side of the Asiatic Christians,
the <i>fact</i> is, that they are reduced to a
very small number, and are insensibly melting
away under the oppressions of their Ottoman
masters; so that in no long time, if that enormous
tyranny should be permitted to continue,
they may, not improbably, quite vanish out
of those countries, where they had formerly so
many and flourishing churches: whereas, the
Jews continue every where to abound in great
numbers; they thrive under their oppressions;
and seem to multiply amidst their distresses;
as if the order of things were reversed in regard
to them, and the same causes operated to
the conservation of this people, which tend so
naturally to the waste and destruction of every
other.</p>

<p>Still, I have another reflexion, or two, to
make on this interesting subject.</p>

<p>1. It deserves to be considered, that the <i>natives</i>
of any country, though subdued and enslaved
by a foreign nation, may, indeed, subsist
very long under that distinction. Thus,
the Gentoo Indians have preserved their name
and race, under their Mahometan invaders:
and thus, the Moors, if they had not been violently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
expelled, might have continued a distinct
people for many ages, in their old Spanish
quarters. But that small colonies of men,
transported into <i>strange</i> and populous nations,
should preserve a distinct existence, and not
insensibly moulder away, and mix themselves
with their numerous native masters; This, I
think, is without example in the history of
mankind. If the Jews might be expected to
abound any where, it should, methinks, be in
Jud&aelig;a; where the sight of the <i>holy land</i>, and
the memory of their past fortunes, might invigorate
their prejudices, and perpetuate their
attachment to the Jewish name and worship.
But it so happens, that the number of Jews
in that country hath now for many ages been
inconsiderable, while they swarm in every
other.</p>

<p>2. It should, further, I think, be observed,
that a <i>sect</i>, whether you will call it of <i>religion</i>,
or <i>philosophy</i>, may subsist through a long
tract of ages; I mean, that certain opinions
may continue to be professed by some people,
or other, without intermission; as may be true
of the <i>doctrine</i> concerning <i>the two principles</i>,
at all times so prevalent in the East; of that
species of eastern <i>idolatry</i>, which consists in
the worship of <i>fire</i>; and in other instances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
But that these opinions, in circumstances any
thing like those of the Jews, should still be
professed, not only by some, but by the <i>same</i>
men, that is, by men known to be of the
same extraction, as well as of a certain persuasion;
this, again, is, I think, a circumstance
of great singularity, and altogether unprecedented
in the case of any other people. Who
knows, of what race or family the present
Manichees are descended, or the professors of
the old Persian idolatry? The followers of
the Mosaic law, are every where known to be
of the stock of Abraham. They are distinguished
in all places, as being Jews by <i>descent</i>,
as well as by <i>Religion</i>.</p>

<p>3. Supposing, what I think cannot be shewn,
that the history of the world furnishes an instance
or two of a people circumstanced in all
respects, as the Jews are; these extraordinary
cases would not much abate the wonder, we
are now contemplating. For how happened
it, that a prophecy delivered above three thousand
years ago concerning the fate of a <i>particular</i>
people, should be so exactly verified, as it
has hitherto been, when that fate is so far
from being a common one, that it has only
taken place, in one or two instances besides,
within the compass of so many ages? And still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
more, how should it enter into the head of
Moses to deliver this prophecy, when, at the
time of his delivering it, he had absolutely no
instance before his eyes of such fate, in the
case of <i>any</i> people?</p>

<p>These things, then, deserve to be well and
seriously considered.</p>

<p>Lastly, We believe, on the faith of the sacred
oracles, that the Jews shall <i>never be destroyed
utterly</i>, but shall exist a distinct people,
as they have hitherto done, <i>till the times
of the Gentiles are fulfilled</i>. But here, you
will say, the prophets indulged a natural prejudice
in favour of their own nation; it being
the way of all people to delight in such dreams
of <i>existence and perpetuity</i>. It may be so:
But see, whether this <i>dream</i> hath ever yet
been so far realized, in the case of any other
people. The Romans, for instance, were as
partial to themselves, and doted as much on
the idea of their <i>perpetuity</i>, as the Jews. But
what now is become of their <i>eternal empire</i>?
Consider, therefore, the singular fate of the
Jews through so many ages, and see whether
it be not credible from what is past, that the
prophet was moved by something more than a
spirit of <i>national vanity</i>, when he said, <i>Fear</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
<i>thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the
Lord, for I am with thee; for I will make a
full end of all the nations whither I have
driven thee</i>, <span class="smcap">but I will not make a full end
of thee</span><a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>.</p>

<p>To these prophecies concerning <i>Jerusalem</i>,
and the <i>Jews</i>, I add</p>

<p>III. <i>A third, concerning</i> <span class="smcap">the call and
conversion of the Gentiles to Christianity</span>.</p>

<p>This prophecy is very remarkable, whether
we consider&mdash;<i>the matter of it</i>&mdash;<i>the persons,
by whom it was delivered</i>&mdash;or, <i>the manner,
in which it hath been fulfilled</i>.</p>

<p>1. As it had been declared from the beginning,
that in the promised seed, <i>all the nations
of the earth should be blessed</i>, so the
Gospel, or, the good tidings of that blessing,
was, in due time, to be communicated to <i>all
nations</i>. Further still, this Gospel was not
only to be published to all nations, but to be
acknowledged and received by them. There
are numberless prophecies to this purpose in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
the books of the Old Testament: prophecies,
which say expressly&mdash;<i>that God would give
unto the Messiah the heathen for his inheritance,
and the uttermost parts of the earth
for his possession</i><a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>&mdash;<i>that from the rising of
the sun even unto the going down of the same,
his name should be great among the Gentiles</i><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>&mdash;<i>It
is a light thing</i>, says the prophet Isaiah,
addressing himself, in the person of the Almighty,
to the Messiah, <i>that thou shouldest
be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob,
and to restore the preserved of Israel; I will
also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that
thou mayest be my salvation to the end of the
earth</i><a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>. And Jesus himself, when he commissioned
his Apostles to publish his doctrine,
did it in these words&mdash;<span class="smcap">Go ye into all the
world, and preach the gospel to every
creature</span><a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>.</p>

<p>It is unquestionable, therefore, from these
and other passages<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>, that not the Jews only,
but all nations were to be instructed in the
Christian faith; that the Gospel was to be an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
universal religion; and that, thus, the Messiah
was to be, in every sense, the Saviour of mankind.
There is no doubt, I say, but that such
is the language of the prophets; and that they
clearly suppose the dispensation of the Gospel
to have these views, and to terminate in this
event.</p>

<p>But now, let any man consider with himself,
what it is to proselyte the whole race of mankind
to one faith, and to one religion. Let
him revolve in his mind this great, this magnificent
idea. Let him, next, turn his thoughts
on what history and experience may suggest to
him on the subject. And then let him tell us,
whether there be not something extraordinary
in this project; whether, indeed, there be any
other example of this sort in the annals of
mankind.</p>

<p>In the old world, the institutors of <i>pagan
religion</i> looked no further, than to single communities:
each destined his ceremonies for his
own people only; and never presumed so far
on the truth or importance of his religious
scheme, as to set it up for a standard of belief
or worship to the other nations of the earth.
Even the <i>Jewish ritual</i> was so constituted as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
to respect the Jews only, and was even practicable
no where but in the land of Jud&aelig;a.</p>

<p>But this idea of universality was equally
strange to the <i>Doctors</i>, as to the Legislators,
of the ancient world. Sects of philosophy,
there were many; espoused with zeal, and
propagated with industry; and some of them,
of no small extent. Yet the most sanguine, or
the most successful of these speculatists never
conceived so much as the idea of bringing all
nations into their system. They presumed,
indeed, that truth, or probability at least, was
on the side of their favourite opinions; but
they beheld a neglect of them in others, with
a sort of indifference; and, contenting themselves
with their own superior skill or felicity,
left it to the rest of the world to philosophize
in their own way, and on their own principles.
They seem not to have thought it either necessary
or possible, that their own sentiments
should become the standing, universal persuasion
of mankind.</p>

<p><i>Ambition</i>, I know, hath been sometimes
enterprizing enough to think of subduing the
whole world. But this was the ambition of
<i>power</i>, not of religion, or philosophy: it was
an ambition to subdue the <i>bodies</i>, not the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
minds of men. This <i>last</i> was a project, too
big for a C&aelig;sar or an Alexander, much more,
for a Numa or an Aristotle, to entertain. And
I think it certain, that, except in the scheme
of Christianity, or such other schemes of revelation
as have been copied from it<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>, we shall
no where find the idea of <i>universality</i> to have
taken place in any religious or philosophical
sect whatsoever<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>.</p>

<p>If then this idea was <i>familiar</i> to the Jewish
and Christian prophets, you will, at least, conclude
that this circumstance is remarkable
enough to engage your attention; and you will
naturally ask, how it came to pass that those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
prophets should adopt so strange a fancy, which
appears not to have entered into the views or
conceptions of other men.</p>

<p>When you are in this train of inquiry, it
will surprize you still more to find,</p>

<p>2. <i>By what persons, these prophecies</i>, so
remarkable for the <i>matter</i> of them, <i>were announced</i>.</p>

<p>The publishers of this extraordinary doctrine
were, in one word, <span class="smcap">Jews</span>: that is, men
of the most narrow and contracted minds;
men, brought up in the highest conceit of
themselves, and in the utmost scorn and contempt
of the Gentiles; men, accustomed to
think themselves the only favourites of Heaven,
and to regard the rest of the world, as outcasts
of its providence; men, in short, induced,
partly, by the genius of their religion, ill understood,
and partly, by their carnal temper,
long indulged, to believe with assurance the
perpetuity, the eternity of their divine law;
and to deem it impossible that God should
reign anywhere but in the land of Israel, or
should impart his blessings to any that lived
out of the Jewish pale.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>Was it, now, to be expected of such men,
as these, that they should enlarge their ideas
so far as to form the project of a new and universal
religion; a religion, not imprinted outwardly
on the flesh, but <i>written in the heart</i>;
a religion, that was to supersede and evacuate
the law of Moses, to which they were so immoderately
addicted, and to enlighten and
bless and save the heathen, whom they so perfectly
despised and abhorred?</p>

<p>You will suspect, perhaps, that the meaning
of these prophecies was no more, than that the
Jewish Law should finally prevail over all other
Laws, and be the sole predominant religion of
the whole earth: a prejudice, very likely, it
may be said, to possess the minds of such a
people as the Jews; and suitable enough to
that zeal, which prompted them <i>to compass
sea and land</i>, as Jesus himself observed of
them, <i>to make one proselyte</i><a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>.</p>

<p>But the contrary is apparent from the <i>structure</i>
of the Jewish Law, which, as I said, was
so contrived, that it could not be observed out
of Jud&aelig;a&mdash;from the <i>tenour</i> of that Law, addressed
only to the house of Israel, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
obligatory to any other people&mdash;from express
<i>declarations</i> of the prophets themselves; who
call the dispensation of the Messiah, <i>a new
Covenant</i>, a covenant <i>written in the heart</i>, in
opposition to the law of circumcision<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>; who
say, that the Lord will <i>create new heavens and
a new earth</i>, that is, in the prophetic language,
will institute a <i>new</i> dispensation of religion,
different from that, which he had
given to the Jews, and <i>subversive</i> of it<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>; who,
lastly, speak of this dispensation, as of <i>one</i>,
that should be established under <i>a new name</i>,
and should be embraced by the Gentiles, as
<i>such</i>, that is, by men, converted immediately
to this new religion from their state of Gentilism,
without passing through the strait gate
of the Jewish Law<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<p>Judge, then, whether the prophets did not
mean more than a <i>proselytism</i> to their own
religion, when they predicted, and in such
terms, the future conversion of the Gentiles;
and whether such ideas, as these, could ever
have entered into the hearts of Jews, if something,
besides and above the natural suggestion
of their own minds, had not inspired their
prophecies.</p>

<p>Add to all this, if you please, that Jesus was
himself a Jew, and (to regard him as a man
only) in the lowest class of the Jews, that is,
of the most confined and bigoted education;
and yet was not restrained by his prejudices
from giving that sublime command to his followers&mdash;<span class="smcap">Go
and teach all nations</span>.</p>

<p>But enough on the <i>doctrine</i> itself, and on
the <i>character</i> of its teachers. It remains only</p>

<p>3. To add one word, <i>on the manner, in
which this prophecy</i>, concerning the conversion
of the Gentile world, <i>appears to have been
completed</i>.</p>

<p>There are especially <small>TWO</small> prophecies on this
subject, which merit our attentive consideration.
<span class="smcap">One</span> of them asserts, that the conversion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
of the Gentile world shall take its rise
from small and very unpromising beginnings,
and yet shall prevail speedily and to a vast
extent; the <small>OTHER</small>, that it shall prevail by pacific
means only, without the intervention of
any force or violence whatsoever.</p>

<p>1. The <small>FORMER</small> of these prophecies is expressed
thus&mdash;<i>A little one shall become a
thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I
the Lord will hasten it in his time</i><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>. In
allusion to this prophecy, concerning the rise
and progress of Christianity, is that parable of
our Lord applied to the kingdom of heaven&mdash;<i>the
kingdom of heaven</i>, says he, <i>is like to a
grain of mustard-seed, which a man took and
sowed in his field: which indeed is the least of
all seeds; but when it is grown, it is the
greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree:
so that the birds of the air come and lodge in
the branches thereof</i><a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>. And, with regard to
the <i>celerity</i> with which this tree should grow
up, we have a prophecy from Christ himself,
and that wonderfully fulfilled&mdash;that <i>his Gospel
should be preached to all the world for a testimony
to all nations</i>, before the destruction of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Jerusalem, or within forty years from the date
of the prophecy.</p>

<p>Now, consider the state of the Gospel, at
our Lord’s ascension. It was left in the hands
of a few, mean, unlearned, dispirited persons:
without any countenance from authority; and
with every difficulty, every terror, opposed to
them, and placed distinctly within their view.
<i>Matth.</i> xxiv. 9. Yet these men were commissioned
to spread this Gospel through the
world, and had an express promise, that they
should succeed in their attempt. Against all
appearance, the success followed. In less than
half a century, <i>the sound of the Gospel went
out into all lands</i>; and, within three centuries
from the death of Christ, Christianity ascended
the imperial throne; <i>and had the utmost parts
of the earth for its possession</i>.</p>

<p>To encrease the wonder, this amazing revolution
was brought about, by <i>pacific methods
only</i>; as was, likewise, foretold</p>

<p>2. In the <small>LATTER</small> of the <i>two</i> prophecies, to
which I before alluded.</p>

<p>Jesus himself quotes this prophecy from
Isaiah in the following words&mdash;<i>Behold, my</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
<i>servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in
whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my
spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment</i>,
i. e. declare a new Law, <i>to the Gentiles. He
shall not strive, nor cry, neither shall any
man hear his voice in the streets; a bruised
reed shall he not break, and smoaking flax
shall he not quench</i>, i. e. (as all interpreters
explain these proverbial expressions) he shall
not employ the least degree of force or violence
in the propagation of this law, <i>till he send
forth judgment unto victory</i>, till it finally prevail
against all opposition; <i>And in his name
shall the Gentiles trust</i>. Matth. xii. 18-21.</p>

<p>Let any man read the history of Christianity,
from its first publication in Jud&aelig;a, to the conversion
of Constantine, and then see whether
this prophecy hath not been exactly and illustriously
completed. The followers of Jesus
were numerous enough, long before the empire
became Christian, to have attempted the
way of force, had it been permitted to them<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>:
and the insults, the oppressions, the persecutions,
which they suffered from their Pagan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
enemies, were enough to provoke the most
passive tempers to some acts of hostility and
resistance<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>. But every one knows, that they
had recourse to no arms, but those of the
spirit: they took no advantage of distracted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
times, to raise commotions in behalf of the
<i>new</i> religion, or to suppress the <i>old</i> one: <i>a
bruised reed did they not break, and smoaking
flax did they not quench</i>: yet with meekness,
and patience, and suffering; by piety, by reason,
by the secret influence of a divine blessing
attending on these feeble efforts, the doctrine
of the cross insensibly gained ground, spread
itself far and wide, and in the end became <i>victorious</i>
over all the rage and power and sophistry
of an unbelieving world<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>That this <i>victory</i> hath not been, hitherto,
so complete, as to answer the promise of an
<i>absolute universality</i>, we readily acknowledge;
but are in no pain for the event<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>; as the same
oracles, which have thus far been verified, suppose
the present condition of things; and,
what is more, assure us of a time to come,
when <i>the fulness of the Gentiles shall come in</i>.</p>

<p>One word more, and I have done. If it be
now thought, that these <small>THREE</small> prophecies&mdash;<i>concerning
the destruction of Jerusalem</i>&mdash;<i>the
dispersion of the Jews</i>&mdash;and <i>the call of the
Gentiles</i>&mdash;have been clearly accomplished;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and yet were of that nature, that no human
foresight could deliver them, nor any probable
conjuncture of human affairs account for the
accomplishment of them, you will conclude
that they were truly divine, and that we do
not abuse your credulity in alledging such prophecies,
in proof of our holy religion. You
will see and acknowledge that there <i>are</i> prophecies,
recorded in scripture, <i>concerning the
Christian Church</i>; and that <i>these</i> prophecies,
in particular, concerning it, have been remarkably
fulfilled. Ye will, therefore, the
less wonder to find, that there are still <i>other</i>
prophecies, relative to the kingdom of Christ,
as administered in this world; and will, of
course, be disposed to consider, with less prejudice,
what may further be said in support of
them.

<span class="large">PROPHECIES CONCERNING
ANTICHRIST.</span><br />

<span class="medium">1 <span class="smcap">Ep. John</span> ii. 18.</span></h2>

<p class="table">&mdash;<i>Ye have heared that Antichrist shall
come</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> the more remarkable prophecies
concerning the Christian Church, there are
several, which describe the rise, progress, and
downfal of a certain Power, represented under
various symbols or images, and distinguished
by many appellations; but more especially
known by the name of <span class="smcap">Antichrist</span>.</p>

<p>These prophecies come now, in the order of
this Lecture, to be considered. The subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
is, in a high degree, curious and important;
but of no easy discussion: not so much on the
account of any peculiar difficulty in the prophecies
themselves, as from the prejudice of
party in <i>explaining</i> them, and still more, from
the general prejudice that lies against every <i>attempt</i>
to explain them.</p>

<p>To make my way through these obstructions,
I shall begin with laying before you a clear
and distinct state of the question itself, which
is chiefly agitated by inquirers into these prophecies.</p>

<p>It is admitted, that many predictions in the
Old and New Testament, particularly in the
book of Daniel, in St. Paul’s Epistles, and in
the Revelations of St. John, clearly point out
a very extraordinary power, which was to
manifest itself <i>in the latter times</i>, that is, in
the times subsequent to the introduction of
Christianity. The characters, by which this
power (acknowledged by all under the name of
Antichrist) is chiefly distinguished, are those
of <i>Tyranny</i><a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>, <i>Idolatry</i>, and <i>Intolerance</i>. And,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
to abridge our trouble in searching after this
<i>three-headed</i> monster, we are directed by the
prophets to look for him within the boundaries
of what is properly called, the Roman Empire,
and even in the city of Rome itself.</p>

<p>Thus far there is no dispute. The only
question is, To what Roman power, exhibiting
those characters, the prophecies are to be
applied. And even this question is reduced
within narrow limits. For <small>TWO</small> Powers only
have subsisted in Rome, from the Christian
&aelig;ra to the present times (within which period
we are, again, allowed to expect the reign of
Antichrist); the Roman Emperor, in the first
place; and, afterwards, the Roman Pontifs.
So that, on the whole, the single point in debate
is merely this, Whether Imperial, or Papal
Rome, be that Antichristian Power, which the
prophets foretold. The church of Rome holds,
for obvious reasons, that the <i>Imperial</i> power
is the object of the prophecies: the Protestants
have, on the contrary, their reasons for maintaining,
that <i>Papal</i> Rome is that power, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
the prophecies had in view, and in which alone
they are truly and properly verified.</p>

<p>This, then, is the meaning of that famous
inquiry concerning Antichrist: and I must desire
you to keep your attention steadily fixed
on the question, as here stated; while I endeavour
to furnish you with the proper means
of deciding upon it.</p>

<p>The obvious method of doing this, would
be, To lay before you, directly, the prophecies
themselves, and to examine them by the light
of sober criticism, and authentic history. But,
because it is no new or difficult thing to misrepresent
<i>facts</i>, and to misinterpret <i>scripture</i>,
to pervert, in short, these two instruments of
truth to any ends, which prejudice hath in view;
and because I know how natural it is for you to
suspect such management in the present case,
where the zeal of party is supposed, on either
side, to exclude, or over-power, the love of
truth; for <i>these reasons</i>, it may be convenient
to take a larger compass, and, by a previous
historical deduction of this controversy, to let
you see in what light it has been regarded,
through the several ages of the Christian
Church.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I. The first account</span>, we meet with in
scripture, of the power in question, I mean,
under his proper name of <i>Antichrist</i>, is in the
first epistle of St. John, from which the text is
taken. The whole passage runs thus&mdash;<i>Little
children, it is the last time: And, as ye have
heard that Antichrist shall come, even now
there are many Antichrists; whereby we know
that it is the last time</i>.</p>

<p>To understand these words, we must call to
mind what hath been already, more than once,
observed concerning the scriptural division of
time into two great portions, The <small>FORMER</small>, and
<small>LATTER</small> times. By the <i>former</i>, is meant the
times preceding the Christian &aelig;ra; by the
<i>latter</i>, the times subsequent to it. Correspondent
to this partition of time, is the double
advent of Christ, of which I before gave a
distinct idea. His <i>first</i> advent was, when he
came in the flesh, at Jerusalem: his <i>second</i> advent
to be understood of his coming in his
kingdom, through all the ages of the Christian
Church.</p>

<p>But though the <i>latter times</i>, in the general
sense of scripture, be thus comprehensive, they
are further subdivided into other constituent
portions, in which some particular state of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Christ’s kingdom is administered, and within
which it is completed. In reference to this
subordinate division of time in the Christian
dispensation, the <i>coming</i> of Christ is, also,
proportionably multiplied. He <i>comes</i> in each
division; that is, as oft as he thinks fit to interpose
by any signal act of his power and providence.
The whole period, in which any
distinct state of his kingdom is carrying on, is
likewise called <i>the latter time</i>; and the concluding
part of that period is distinguished by
the name of the <i>last hour</i>: as if the whole of
each period were considered as <i>one day</i>; and
the close of each period, as the end, or <i>last
hour</i>, of that day.</p>

<p>Thus, the time that elapsed from Christ’s
ascension to the destruction of Jerusalem, being
one of the subdivisions, before mentioned, is
called the <i>latter times</i>; and the eve of its destruction,
is called the <i>last hour</i>. He <i>was
coming</i> through the whole time: he <i>came</i> in
the end of it. And the like use of these terms
is to be made, in other instances. We are to
apply them in the same manner to the <i>reign
of Antichrist</i>&mdash;<i>to the Millennium</i>&mdash;to the
<i>day of judgment</i>. Each of these states, into
which the <i>latter times</i>, or the times of Christianity,
are divided, is likewise spoken of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
under the idea of the <i>latter times</i>; and the
season, in which each is drawing to an end, is
the <i>last hour</i> of that state<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>.</p>

<p>Thus much being premised, it is easy to
give a just exposition of the text. <i>Little children,
it is the last time</i>, or <i>hour</i>&mdash;that is, the
destruction of Jerusalem is at hand; as indeed
it followed very soon after the date of this
Epistle. <i>And, as ye have heared that Antichrist
shall come</i>&mdash;that, in some future period,
called the <i>last times</i>, an hostile power, which
we know by the name of Antichrist, shall arise
and prevail in the world, <i>even now</i>, we may
see the commencement of that power; for,
<i>there are many Antichrists</i>; many persons,
now, appear in the spirit of that future Antichrist,
and deserve his name: <i>whereby</i>, indeed,
<i>we know that it is the last hour</i>: for
Christ himself had made the appearance of
false Christs and false prophets, that is, of Antichrists,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
to be one of the signs by which that
<i>hour</i> should be distinguished<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>.</p>

<p>The meaning of the whole passage, then, is
clearly this: “That the appearance of <i>false
Christs</i> and <i>false Prophets</i> (of which there
were many, according to our Lord’s prediction,
in St. John’s time) indicated the arrival of that
<i>hour</i>, that was to be fatal to the Jewish state:
and that they were, at the same time, the
types and forerunners of a still more dreadful,
power, which should be fully revealed in <i>the
latter times</i>, in a future period, when that calamity
was past.” For the truth of the assertion,
That such a power should arise in the
Christian church, he appeals to a tradition,
then current among the disciples: and his
hated name of <i>Antichrist</i> is here applied, by
way of anticipation, to the false prophets of
that time; as possessing much of his character,
and acting with his spirit.</p>

<p>Hence we see the meaning of the word, <i>Antichrist</i>;
which stands for a person or power,
actuated with a spirit opposite to that of Christ.
And so indeed the Apostle explains himself, in
another place of this very Epistle. For, speaking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
of certain false teachers, who preached up
a doctrine, contrary to that of the Gospel, he
adds&mdash;“This is that <i>spirit</i> of Antichrist,
whereof ye have heard that it should come,
and even now already is it in the world<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>.”
And I lay the greater stress on this observation,
because the etymology of the word, <i>Antichrist</i>,
makes it capable of two different meanings.
For it may either signify one, who <i>assumes
the place and office of Christ</i>, or one, who
<i>maintains a direct enmity and opposition to
him</i><a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>. But the <i>latter</i>, is the sense in which
the Apostle useth this term; although it be
true that, in the <i>former</i> sense, it very well
suits the Bishop of Rome, who calls himself
the <i>Vicar</i> of Christ, as well as the successor of
St. Peter. Nor can there be any difficulty in
fixing the charge of Antichristianism, in the
sense of <i>an enmity and opposition to Christ</i>,
on the Roman Pontif (though I know how absurd
the attempt seems to the writers on that
side); for, to merit this charge, it is not necessary
that he should formally reject Christ,
which undoubtedly he does not, but that he
should act in defiance to the true genius and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
character of Christ’s religion: a charge, which
may be evidently made good against him.</p>

<p>In short, as the word, <i>Christ</i>, is frequently
used in the Apostolic writings for the <i>doctrine</i>
of Christ; in which sense we are said to <i>put on
Christ</i>, to <i>grow in Christ</i>, to <i>learn Christ</i>,
and in other instances: So <i>Antichrist</i>, in the
abstract, may be taken for a doctrine subversive
of the Christian; and when applied to a
particular man, or body of men, it denotes
<i>one</i>, who sets himself against the <i>spirit</i> of that
doctrine<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>In this last sense, the word <i>Antichrist</i> is
clearly employed by St. John: and from his
example, the word grew into general use in
the Christian church; and is so to be understood,
whenever mention is made of Antichrist
by the primitive fathers, or any other ecclesiastical
writers.</p>

<p>II. I am now to shew in what manner the
prophecies concerning <i>Antichrist</i>, or a person
or power, so called, and, though variously described,
always considered under the idea of
an adversary to the true doctrine of Christ,
have been construed and applied by many eminent
members of the Christian Church, in all
ages.</p>

<p>1. When the canon of scripture was formed,
and new in the hands of the faithful, the prophecies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
concerning Antichrist were too remarkable
not to take their early attention. They
accordingly cite these prophecies in their apologies
and commentaries, or refer to them,
very frequently. But one thing is singular.
Though Antichrist be every where spoken of
in the prophecies as a persecuting power, and
though the Christian church then was, and so
continued to be for near three centuries, in a
state of persecution under the Roman emperors,
yet this opprobrious name was not
usually given to their persecutors. I do not
say, that none of the early Christian writers
ever applied that character to the Emperors.
Some few of them, in a fit of zeal and resentment,
did<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>. But the most, and the ablest of
the Fathers, were clearly of another opinion.</p>

<p>It may be thought, that they forbore this
application of so odious a term, out of respect
to the government under which they lived,
and from prudential considerations. These
motives had, without doubt, their weight with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
them, and made them more cautious, than
they would otherwise have been, in interpreting
the prophecies. But, if they had been at
liberty to speak out, and declare their full
sense, on the subject, it is certain they would
not, and could not, consistently with their
avowed principles, apply the prophecies concerning
Antichrist to the Roman Emperors.
For they had learned from tradition, and from
the letter of the prophecies, that Antichrist
was to be revealed in some distant age; and
they even collected from a remarkable passage
in one of St. Paul’s Epistles (which will be
considered hereafter) that the removal of the
Roman empire was to make way for his appearance.
Hence, they give it as a reason for
their ardent prayers to Heaven for the preservation
of the empire, that the dreaded power
of Antichrist could not commence, so long as
the Imperial sovereignty subsisted. And it is
observable that, of those few writers, who were
in different sentiments, the greater part conceived
the time of his coming to be <i>remote</i>;
and were even driven to the strange necessity
of supposing that Nero, the first persecuting
Emperor, was miraculously kept alive, or would
be raised up from the dead, in order to be revealed
in a future age, as the Antichrist of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
the prophets, or at least as the <i>Precursor</i> of
Antichrist<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>.</p>

<p>In short, the idea, which the early Christians,
in general, formed of Antichrist, was
that of a power, to be revealed in distant times,
after the dissolution of the Roman empire; of
a power, to arise out of the ruins of that empire.
Not to multiply quotations, on a point
which admits no doubt, Jerom, the ablest of
the ancient Fathers, and the most esteemed,
shall speak for the rest. He says expressly,
that such was the idea of <i>all the ecclesiastical
writers</i>, down to his time, as is here represented<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>.</p>

<p>Now this circumstance ye will surely think
not a little remarkable, that they, who lived
under the emperors, and felt the whole weight
of their tyrannous persecution, should not apply
the prophetic notes and characters of Antichrist,
to <i>them</i>, if indeed the prophecies had
been fairly capable of such application. This,
I say, is exceedingly remarkable: for men are
but too apt even to wrest the scriptures to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
sense, which favours their own cause, or gratifies
their passions; and to find a completion of
prophecy in events, which fall out in their own
days and concern themselves (as we see from so
many absurd applications of the Apocalypse,
justly objected to certain Protestant writers);
though, when such events are past, and impartially
considered, no such accomplishment
of prophecy can be discerned in them.</p>

<p>When the church of Rome, therefore, now
pretends, that Antichrist is to be sought in Imperial
and Pagan Rome, ye will naturally ask
how it came to pass, that the ancient fathers,
who had the best opportunity of seeing the
conformity of the prophecies with the transactions
of their times, and were so much interested
in those transactions, should yet overlook
such conformity, if it had been real, and
fairly marked out by the prophecies, when interpreters
of these days are so quick-sighted?
And to this question, no just and satisfactory
answer can be given, but that, in the opinion
of those fathers, the characters of Antichrist
were not sufficiently applicable to the Roman
emperors; or, if they were, that certain express
clauses in the prophecies themselves forbade
that application of them. Either way,
their conduct forms a strong presumption, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the Antichrist of the prophets was not, and
could not be, the Roman Emperor.</p>

<p>I know indeed, that, when the empire became
Christian, and factions sprang up in the
church, the name of Antichrist, as a term of
reproach, was not unfrequently bestowed on
such of the emperors as had made themselves
obnoxious to the orthodox party. But this
flippancy of language proves nothing but the
passion of the men who indulged themselves in
it, unless it be, that this term of reproach was
thought better suited to an ecclesiastic, than a
civil power: for the Emperor, being now the
head of the Christian church, his persecutions
of the faith were deemed the more <i>Antichristian</i>,
as they especially disgraced his <i>religious
character</i>. And how natural this idea was, I
mean the idea of <i>Antichrist</i>, as intended by
the prophets of a <i>religious</i>, not civil power,
we may learn from the history of the schisms,
which afterwards distracted the church under
the papacy; when the Antipopes very liberally,
and constantly branded each other with the
name of <i>Antichrist</i>: as if they had found a
peculiar aptness in the prophetic language
to express ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>But, whatever use we may make of these
facts, it is clear, on all hands, that the Roman
Emperor, <i>as such</i>, was thought to have no
concern in the predictions concerning Antichrist;
at least, that the more intelligent
Christian writers of the three first centuries
had no idea of his having any such concern in
them: while, yet, they held very unanimously,
that some future power was to arise
in the church, in which those predictions
would be completed.</p>

<p>III. This, in general, was the state of the
controversy concerning Antichrist, till the
down-fall of the Western empire; when the
Bishop of Rome reared his head, and by degrees
found means, amidst the ruins of that
mighty power, to advance himself into the
sovereignty of Rome, and, at length, of the
Christian world: fixing his residence in the
very seat and throne of the C&aelig;sars. It remains
to see, in what light the reign of Antichrist
was, thenceforth, considered by many eminent
members of that church, which now called itself,
and was, in a manner, <i>universal</i>. In
other words, we are to inquire, now that the
imperial power, which the fathers would not
acknowledge to be Antichristian, had deserted
Rome, whether the papal power, which took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
its place on <i>the seven hills</i>, did not, in the
opinion of sober men, fill up all the measures
of the prophetic characters, and perfectly correspond
to that idea.</p>

<p>1. So early, as about the close of the sixth
century, Gregory the first, or, the <i>Great</i>, as
he is usually called, the most revered, and in
some respects not undeservedly so, of all the
Roman pontifs, in a famous dispute with the
Bishop of Constantinople, who had taken to
himself the title of <i>Oecumenical</i>, or Universal
Bishop, objects to him, the arrogance and
presumption of this claim, and treats him, on
that account, as the fore-runner, at least, of
Antichrist. His words are remarkable enough
to be here quoted. <i>I affirm it confidently</i>,
says He, <i>that whoever calls himself Universal
Bishop, or is desirous to be so called, demonstrates
himself, by this pride and elation of
heart, to be the fore-runner of Antichrist</i><a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>.
And, again, <i>From this presumption of his</i> [in
taking the name of Universal Bishop] <i>what
else can be collected, but that the times of Antichrist
are now at hand</i><a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>It is to be observed of this Gregory, that he
disclaimed, for himself, the title of Universal
Bishop, as well as refused it to his aspiring
brother of Constantinople. How consistently
he did this, when at the same time, he exercised
an authority, which can only belong to
that exalted character, it is not my business to
inquire. Perhaps, he did not advert to the
consequence of his own actions: perhaps, like
an able man, he meant to secure the thing,
without troubling himself about the name:
perhaps, he was jealous of a rival to this claim
of catholic authority, and would not permit
the Bishop of Constantinople to decorate himself
with a title, which was likely to be favourable
to the pretensions of that see, and injurious
to his own. Whatever the reasons of his
conduct were, the <i>fact</i> is, as I here represent
it; and clearly shews that, in the judgment of
this renowned Roman Bishop, Antichrist had
not yet been revealed in the person of the Roman
Emperor; and if ever he were to be revealed,
that not a civil, but ecclesiastical character,
agreed best with the prophetic descriptions
of him<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

<p>2. Pope Boniface III. had not, it seems, the
scruples, whatever they were, of his predecessor,
Gregory. He readily accepted, or rather
importunately begged, this proud title of <i>Oecumenical
Bishop</i>, from the Emperor, Phocas;
and transmitted it to all his successors. And
now, it might be expected, that the Bishop of
Rome would be Antichrist, in his turn. But,
such was the fortune of that see, or the devotion
of the faithful to it, that this charge was
not presently brought against him: as if the
spirit of dominion, which had so long possessed
that city, were a thing of course, and could
not misbecome the Bishop of Rome, though it
looked so <i>Antichristian</i> in him of Constantinople.</p>

<p>Other reasons concurred to save the honour
of the papal chair. Its authority grew, every
day, more absolute: and the tradition of the
church (which had hitherto been the chief support
of the doctrine concerning Antichrist) gradually
sunk under the apprehension of that
power, to which alone it could, with any apparent
propriety, be applied: while the ignorance
of the times became such, that, except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
perhaps in the minds of some few retainers to
the see of Rome, there was scarce light enough
left in the Christian world to point out the
meaning of the prophecies; if its gross superstition
would have otherwise permitted the application
of them to the sacred person of the
Pope.</p>

<p>3. Under the cover of all these advantages,
<i>the Man of Sin</i> had a convenient time to display
himself, and to grow up into that full size
and stature, in which he could no longer be
overlooked, or mistaken, by those who had
any knowledge of the prophecies, or skill in
applying them. Accordingly we find that at
the synod of Rheims, held in the Xth century<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>,
Arnulphus, Bishop of Orleans, appealed
to the whole council, whether the Bishop
of Rome were not the Antichrist of the
prophets; <i>sitting in the temple of God</i>; and
perfectly corresponding to the marks, which
St. Paul had given of him. In particular,
speaking of John the XVth, who then governed
the church of Rome, he apostrophized
the assembly in these words&mdash;“What think
ye, reverend Fathers, of this man, seated on a
lofty throne, and shining in purple and gold?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Whom do ye account him to be? Surely, if
destitute of charity, and puffed up with the
pride of science only, He is <span class="smcap">Antichrist</span>, <i>sitting
in the temple of God, and shewing himself
that he is God</i><a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>.”</p>

<p>4. In the former part of the XIth century,
Berengarius, a man of principal note in those
days, and distinguished by his free writings
concerning the Eucharist, went so far as to
call the church of Rome, <i>the seat of Satan</i>
(which is but another apocalyptic name of Antichrist);
and to know from what source he
derived this language, we need only reflect,
that, in the catalogue of his works, we find a
treatise written by him expressly on the book
of Revelations<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>As this century advanced, the papal power
rose to its height. And all the characters of
Antichrist glared so strongly in the person of
Hildebrand, who took the name of Gregory
VIIth, that the Romish historian, Joannes
Aventinus, speaks of it as a point, <i>in which
the generality of fair, candid, and ingenuous
writers, were agreed, That</i> <small>THEN</small> <i>began the
empire of Antichrist</i><a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>.</p>

<p>5. Pascal II, who had been brought up at
the feet of Hildebrand, and sate upon the papal
throne in the beginning of the XIIth century,
was treated with as little ceremony, as his
master had been; particularly, by Fluentius,
Bishop of Florence, and by the whole church
of Liege<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>.</p>

<p>St. Bernard, too, the most eminent person
of that age, was so struck with the marks of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Antichristianism in the church of Rome (to
which, however, in other respects, he was
enough devoted) that he employed all the thunder
of his rhetoric (in which faculty he excelled)
against its corruptions; exclaiming, <i>that
the ministers of Christ were become the servants
of Antichrist; and that the beast of the
Apocalypse had seated himself in the chair of
St. Peter</i><a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>But this charge was now so general, and
sounded so high, that it reached the ears of <i>others</i>,
besides prelates, and churchmen. Historians
relate, that it made an impression on our military
king, Richard I.; who, being at Messina
in Sicily, in his way to the Holy Land, and
hearing much of the learned Abbot Joachim of
Calabria, (a man, famous in those times for
his warm invectives against the Roman hierarchy;)
had the curiosity to take a lecture from
him on this subject. His text was, <i>Antichrist</i>,
and the <i>Apocalypse</i>; which he explained in so
pointed and forcible a manner, as was much
to the satisfaction, we are told, of his royal
auditor<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>.</p>

<p>6. The first appearance of the people, called
Waldenses or Albigenses, was in this age;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
but, in the next, the XIIIth century, they
prevailed to that degree, that Crusades and Inquisitions
were thought little enough to be employed
against them. We may know what
the guilt of this people was, when we understand
from their books, and from the testimony
of the great historian, Thuanus, that a leading
principle of their heresy was, To treat the
Pope as <i>Antichrist</i>; and the church of Rome,
as <i>Babylon</i>; on the authority of the prophecies
contained in the Revelation<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Other<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> testimonies occur in the history of
this age. But I must not omit that of our
famous historian, Matthew Paris; who hath
taken care to inform us, that his contemporary,
Robert Grost&ecirc;te, Bishop of Lincoln, the most
considerable of all the English bishops, and
equally renowned for his affection to civil and
religious liberty, was so much in earnest in
fixing this charge on the see of Rome, that, as
it had been the common theme of his meditations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
during life, so it occupied his dying moments;
the <i>Pope</i>, and <i>Antichrist</i>, being, as
he tells us, among the last words of this zealous
prelate<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>.</p>

<p>7. The XIVth century affords many authorities
in point; among which the immortal
names of Dante<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Petrarch<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> are commonly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
cited. But the example of our Wicklif, who
adorned that age, is most to our purpose, and
may excuse the mention of any other. This
extraordinary man saw far into all the abuses
of his time: but he had nothing more at heart,
than to expose the <i>Antichristianism</i> of the Roman
Pontif<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>.</p>

<p>8. Still, as the times grew more enlightened,
the controversy concerning Antichrist became
more general and important. The writings of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
Wicklif had great effects both at home, and
abroad; and, with other causes, contributed
very much to the cultivation of free enquiry,
and to the improvement of all useful knowledge,
in the XVth century. The church of
Rome was pushed vigorously on all sides; and,
in her turn, omitted no means of self-defence.
That the <i>worst</i> were not scrupled, may be
seen by what passed in England at that time,
as well as by the sanguinary and faithless proceedings
at the council of Constance. Lord
Cobham, and the two Bohemian martyrs, were
committed to the flames, for nothing so much,
as for asserting the impious doctrine, ‘That
the Pope was Antichrist.’</p>

<p>9. We now enter on the XVIth century;
distinguished in the annals of mankind by that
great event, The Reformation of long oppressed
and much adulterated religion. The Christian
world had slumbered in its chains, for full ten
ages. But Liberty came at last&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Libertas, qu&aelig; sera tamen respexit</i> <small>INERTEM</small>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This important work was begun, and prosecuted,
on the common principle, That the
bishop of Rome was Antichrist: and the great
separation from the church of Rome, was every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
where justified on the idea, That Rome was
the Babylon of the Revelation; and that
Christians were bound by an express command
in those prophecies, to <i>come out of her</i> communion.</p>

<p>Leo X. was thunder-struck with this cry,
which resounded on all sides; and, in the last
Lateran council, gave it in charge to all preachers,
that none of them should presume to call
the Pope, Antichrist, or to treat this obnoxious
subject in their discourses to the people<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>.
But his edict came too late. The notion had
taken deep root in the minds of men; and the
name of Antichrist, as applied to the Pope,
was current in all quarters.</p>

<p>10. From this time to the present, <i>the charge
of Antichristianism</i> against the church of Rome
is to be regarded, not as the language of private
men, or particular synods; but as the common
voice of the whole Protestant world: so that it
will be needless to bring down the history of
it any lower.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This deduction</span>, though made with all possible
brevity, hath held us so long, that I
have but time for one or two short reflexions
upon it.</p>

<p>1. <i>First</i>, It may seem probable from the
general prevalence of this opinion, in all the
periods of the Christian church, that it must
needs have some solid ground in the scriptural
prophecies: it not being otherwise conceivable,
that it should spread so far, and continue
so long; or that the more enlightened, as well
as barbarous ages should concur in the profession
of it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Secondly</i>, from the catalogue of illustrious
names, here produced, and from the singular
stress, which all Protestant churches to
this day have ever laid on this principle, we
may see the importance of the general question.
The papal divines have an evident reason for
treating it with contempt. The men of
thought and inquiry, who speculate within the
Roman communion, may be restrained by considerations
of fear or decency, from joining<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
in this invidious charge against the head of
their church. But for any, that profess Christianity,
and call themselves Protestants, to
make light of inquiries into the prophecies
concerning Antichrist, and to manifest a scorn
of all attempts to apply them in the way, in
which they have so generally, and with such
effect been applied, is a sort of conduct, which
will not so readily find an excuse, much less a
justification.</p>

<p>3. <i>Lastly</i>, whatever becomes of the <i>truth</i>,
or <i>importance</i> of the doctrine, the <i>antiquity</i> of
it is not to be disputed. For we are authorised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
to affirm, on the most certain grounds of history,
that a Roman power, commonly called
Antichrist, was expected to arise in <i>the latter
times</i>, by the primitive Christians; and that
the Imperial, was not deemed to be that power,
so long as it subsisted. It is, further, unquestionable
that not the Emperor, but the
Bishop or Church of Rome, was afterwards
thought entitled to the name of Antichrist by
many persons of that communion, for several
successive centuries, previous to the &aelig;ra of the
Reformation.</p>

<p>These facts should abate the wonder, at
least, which some express at hearing the names
of the <i>Pope</i> and <i>Antichrist</i> pronounced together.
They must surely convince every man,
that this language, whatever foundation it
may, or may not have, in the prophecies, is
not taken up without precedents and authorities;
and that the notion, conveyed by it, is
not a conceit of yesterday, which sprung out
of recent prejudices, and novel interpretations.
This, I say, is a conclusion which every man
must draw from the premises, laid down in
this discourse: and this, for the present, is the
main use I would request you to make of
those premises.

<span class="large">PREJUDICES AGAINST THE
DOCTRINE OF ANTICHRIST.</span><br />

<span class="medium">1 <span class="smcap">Ep. John</span> ii. 18.</span></h2>

<p class="table">&mdash;<i>Ye have heared that Antichrist shall
come</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> of the principal prejudices against the
doctrine of Antichrist, as understood and applied
by Protestant divines, arises out of a circumstance,
which was just touched in the close of
my last discourse, and is of importance enough
to be now resumed and more particularly considered.</p>

<p>I. It is well known that, when the Reformation
was set on foot in the sixteenth century,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
this great work was every where justified
and conducted on the general principle, “That
the Pope, or at least the church of Rome, was
Antichrist.”</p>

<p>“Now men of sense, who have looked no
farther into the subject, and yet remember, as
they easily may, the bitterness, the policy,
the fraud, too commonly observable in the conduct
of religious (as of other) parties, easily fall
into the suspicion, That this cry of Antichrist
was only an artifice of the time, or at least an
extravagance of it; when the minds of men were
intensely heated against each other, and when
of course no arms would be refused, that might
serve to annoy or distress the enemy.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, it was natural enough,
it will be said, for angry men to <i>see</i> that in the
prophecies which was not contained in them;
or for designing men to <i>feign</i> that which they
did not see; in order the more effectually to
carry on the cause in which they had embarked,
and to seduce the unwary multitude
into their quarrel. In short, the passions of
the Reformed, it is readily presumed, had,
some way or other, conjured up this spectre of
Antichrist, as a convenient engine, by which
they might either gratify their own spleen, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
excite that of the people; the prophecies all
the while being no further concerned in the
question, than as they were wrested for these
purposes (as they frequently have been, in like
cases) from their true and proper meaning.”</p>

<p>To remove this capital prejudice (which,
more than any other, hath, perhaps, diverted
serious men from giving a due attention to this
argument) was the main purpose of the preceding
discourse; in which it was clearly shewn
from historical testimony, that the question
concerning Antichrist had its rise in the earliest
times; that the prophecies concerning Antichrist,
though imperfectly enough understood,
and, it may be, passionately applied, had yet,
been considered, very generally, as referring to
<i>some</i> corrupt Christian and even ecclesiastical
person or power; and that many eminent
members of the Christian church had even applied
those prophecies to the <i>same</i> person or
power, to which Protestants now apply them,
and for the <i>same</i> end, which Protestants have
in view, when they apply them to such person
or power, for many successive centuries, before
the Reformation began. From all which it is
undeniable, that the Reformers did not innovate
in the interpretation of the prophecies concerning
Antichrist; and that their application
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
of them to the see of Rome, was not a contrivance,
which sprung out of the passionate
resentments, or interested policies of that time.</p>

<p>It is true indeed (for the truth should not,
and needs not be concealed) that the Reformers
were forward enough to lay hold on this received
sense of the prophecies, and to make
their utmost advantage of it; the account of
which matter is, briefly, this: The Christian
church had now for many ages been held together
in a close dependence on the chair of
St. Peter; and to secure and perpetuate that
dependence, was the principal object and concern
of the papal court. Various means were
employed for this purpose; but the most effectual
was thought to be, to inculcate in the
strongest terms on the minds of Christians the
absolute necessity of communicating with the
Bishop of Rome, as the centre of unity, and,
by divine appointment, the supreme visible
head of the Christian world. Hence, to renounce
in any degree the authority and jurisdiction
of Rome, was deemed the most inexpiable
of all sins. The name of <span class="smcap">Schism</span> was
fastened upon it; a name, which was sounded
higher than that of Heresy itself, as implying
in it the accumulated guilt of Apostacy, and
Infidelity. The way of heaven was shut against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
all offenders of this sort; and, to make their
condition as miserable, as it was hopeless, all
the engines of persecution, such as racks, fires,
gibbets, inquisitions, and even Crusades, had
been employed against them: as was seen in
the case of the Albigenses and others, who, at
different times, had attempted to withdraw
themselves from the papal dominion.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things, when the bold
spirit of Luther resolved, at all adventures, to
break through this inveterate servitude<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>, so
dextrously imposed on the Christian world,
under the pretence, and in the name, of ecclesiastical
union. Yet the peril of the attempt
was easily foreseen, or was presently felt. And,
therefore, the Reformers (to prevent the ill
effects which the dreadful name of <i>Schism</i>
might have on themselves and their cause, and
to satisfy at once their own consciences and
those of their adherents) not only revived and
enforced the old charge of <i>Antichristianism</i>
against the church of Rome; but further insisted
(on the authority of those prophecies
which justified the charge) that Christians were
bound in conscience, by the most express command,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
to break all communion with her. The
expedient, one sees, was well calculated to
serve the purpose in hand: but still the command
was truly and pertinently alledged; for
it exists in so many words (however the blindness
or the bigotry of former times had overlooked
it) in the book of the <i>Revelations</i><a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>.
So that whoever admitted the <i>charge</i> itself to
be well founded, could not reject this <i>consequence</i>
of it, That Christ and Antichrist had
no fellowship with each other. And on this
popular ground, chiefly, the Protestant cause,
in those early times, was upheld; with no
small advantage to the patrons of it; it being
now clear, that the invidious imputation of
Schism had lost its malignity in the general
obligation, which lay upon Christians, to renounce
all communion with the church of
Rome.</p>

<p>This being the true account of that zeal,
with which the doctrine of Antichrist was asserted
in the days of Reformation, let us see
how the case stands at present; and whether
any reasonable prejudice lies against the doctrine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
itself, from the uses, that were then so
happily made of it.</p>

<p>In the first place, The injunction, <i>to come
out of her</i>, was, as I observed, not forged by
the Reformers; nor (admitting that church
to be Antichristian) was it misrepresented by
them. Every reader of the prophecies must
confess, that the command is clearly delivered,
and that the sense of it is not mistaken. How
serviceable soever, therefore, this topic was to
the cause of reformation, it is not, on that account,
to be the less esteemed by the just and
candid inquirer.</p>

<p>In the next place, I will freely admit, that
the dread, in which most men, if not all men<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
of that time, were held, of incurring the imputation
of Schism, was much greater, than
the occasion required, and, upon the whole, a
sort of panic terror. For, though a causeless
separation from the church would indeed have
loaded the Reformers with much and real guilt,
yet when the abuses of it had risen to that
height as to reduce an honest man to the alternative,
either of committing sin, or of leaving
its communion, they might well have justified
themselves on the evident necessity of the
thing, and had no need of a positive command
to authorize their separation. All this is, now,
clearly seen; and if the first Reformers did
not see thus much (as very probably they did
not) all that follows is, That the doctrine of
Antichrist, from which that command derived
its effect, was less necessary to their cause,
than they supposed it to be; not, that the
doctrine itself is without authority, or the command
without obligation.</p>

<p>Lastly, I observe, that, though the <i>violences</i>
of the time might force the Reformers to take
shelter in this doctrine of Antichrist, and
though the <i>prejudices</i> of the time might induce
them to take the advantage, they did, of it;
yet, neither of these considerations affords any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
just presumption against the doctrine, as it lies
in scripture, and is enforced by us at this time
out of it; because we argue, not from their authority,
but from the prophecies themselves;
which are much better understood by us, than
they were by them; and are still maintained
to speak the sense, which they put upon them,
I mean with respect to the general application
of them to the church of Rome, though we
have nothing to apprehend either from the
power of that church, or from the prejudices
of the people.</p>

<p>Let no man, therefore, rashly conclude,
from the free use made of this doctrine by our
old Reformers (and there is scarce one of them
that has not left behind him a tract or discourse
on Antichrist) that it hath no better or
other foundation, than in their interests or passions.
A reasonable man sees, that it has no
dependance at all upon them. That Luther,
indeed, heated in the controversy with the
church of Rome, and smoaking, as I may say,
from the recent blast of the papal thunders,
should cry out, <span class="smcap">Antichrist</span><a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>, shall pass, if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
you will, for a sally of rage and desperation<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>.
But that we, at this day, who revolve the prophecies
at our ease, and are in little more dread
of modern Rome, than of ancient Babylon,
should still find the resemblance so striking as
to fall upon the same idea; and should even be
driven against the strong bias of prejudice
(which with us, in England, for above a century
past, has drawn the other way) to adopt
the language of our great Reformer; this, I
say, is a consideration of another sort, and
will not be put off so slightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Still</span>, there are other prejudices, which oppose
themselves to this great Protestant principle,
<i>That the Pope is Antichrist</i>; and these,
it will not be beside the purpose of this Lecture
to consider. It may, then, be said,</p>

<p>II. “That, although there be not the same
evident necessity for bringing this odious
charge against the Papacy, as there was formerly
in the infancy of Reformation, yet obvious
reasons are not wanting, which may possibly
induce the Protestant churches of our
times to repeat and inforce it. So long as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
separation is kept up, the partizans of the
cause will not scruple to lay hold on every popular
topic, by which it may be promoted.
But an <i>ill name</i>, is the readiest of all expedients,
and generally the most effectual, for this
service. And as <i>Heretic</i> is the term in use,
when the church of Rome would discredit the
Reformation; so, <i>Antichrist</i> serves just as well,
in the mouth of a Protestant, to disgrace the
Catholic party. Hence, the people are gratified
in a low spite against the person of the
Pope; the better sort are confirmed in their
religious or politic aversion to the church of
Rome; and Princes themselves are invited to
come in aid of the prophecies, by turning their
arms and councils against a godless antichristian
tyranny: and all this, to the ruin of public
peace, and in defiance of Christian charity.”</p>

<p>When men declaim, instead of arguing, or,
what is worse, when they argue from their
suspicions only, it may not be easy to give
them an answer to their satisfaction. Otherwise,
one might reply,</p>

<p><i>First</i>, That the question is not, what use
has been, or may be, made of this doctrine
concerning Antichrist; but whether there be
reason to believe that such doctrine is really
contained in sacred scripture. If there be, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
will become us to treat it with respect, how
much soever it may have been misapplied, or
perverted.</p>

<p>In the <i>next place</i>, one might observe that
no man, who understood the state of this controversy,
ever applied the prophecies concerning
Antichrist to the <i>person</i> of the Pope, but
in general to the church of Rome, or rather to
the Antichristian spirit, by which it is governed;
or, if to the <i>Pope</i>, to him only as representing
that society, of which he is the
head; and so far only, as he acted in the spirit
of it. And there is nothing strange or unusual
in this use of the term. When Hobbes wrote
his famous book, called <span class="smcap">Leviathan</span> (a word,
now at least, of almost as ill sound, as Antichrist
itself) no man supposes, that he meant
to apply this character, exclusively, to the
person of any prince, then living; but, in
general, to <i>civil government</i>, according to the
ideas he had formed of it. And this way of
speaking, as I have before observed, is especially
familiar to the sacred writers. Many of
the Popes are said to have been, and, for any
thing I know, <i>may</i> have been, <i>Saints</i>, in their
private morals: so that when we apply the
term, Antichrist, to them, we do not mean
to stigmatize their <i>persons</i>, but merely to express
the sense which the prophecies lead us to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
entertain of the communion, over which they
preside; though they may not exemplify in
their own conduct, or not in any remarkable
degree, the avowed principles of that communion.</p>

<p>Conceive, therefore, with more respect of
Protestant divines, when they explain and vindicate
the prophecies concerning Antichrist,
than to suppose, that they indulge in themselves,
or would encourage in others, <i>a low
spite against the person of the Roman Pontif</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, It is to be observed, that, although
this prophetic language may tend to confirm
Protestants <i>in a religious, or</i>, if you will, <i>politic
aversion to the church of Rome</i>; yet it is
not therefore to be forborn, if the scriptures
do, indeed, authorize the use of it; nor is there
any hurt done, if the principles of that church
be not misrepresented; for then, such aversion
becomes the wisdom and the duty of all Christians.
Besides, this aversion proceeds no farther
in well-informed Protestants, than to keep
them at distance from the Romish communion,
and to admonish others of their obligation to
forsake it. And, if the members, above all,
if the rulers, of that communion would restrain
<i>their</i> zeal within the same bounds (though they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
would not, we say, be equally justified in this
zeal) neither public peace, nor Christian charity,
would suffer by it.</p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, it should be remembered, That,
when the prophecies foretell the downfall of
Antichrist, and even go so far as to point out
to us the princes of that communion, as the
destined instruments of such catastrophe; yet
neither is hereby any duty imposed on those
princes to make war upon the Pope, nor any
encouragement given to Protestants themselves
to concur in any such measures. For the
prophets simply predict an <i>event</i>; and do not
deliver in their prediction, or propose to deliver,
<i>rules</i> for our conduct. Our Saviour
himself, speaking by the spirit, and in the
language of prophecy, said&mdash;<i>I come not to
send peace on earth, but a sword</i>. But will
any man suppose that this prediction justifies,
or was meant in any degree to justify, that
state of things, which it describes, and which
the author of it foresaw would too certainly
come to pass? Nor think, that the event predicted,
I mean, <i>the fall of Antichrist</i>, will
not take place, unless our invectives, or hostile
attempts, make way for it. If the prediction
be divine, there is <span class="smcap">One</span>, who will see that it
be accomplished. Princes and States may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
nothing less in view than to fulfill the prophecies
of sacred Scripture: yet, when the appointed
time is come, they will certainly fulfill
them, though they never thought <i>of coming in
aid of the prophecies</i>&mdash;though we should not
encourage them in any such presumptuous design&mdash;nay,
though we should do our utmost,
as it is our duty to do, to restrain vindictive
and ill-advised men from turning their arms
even against Antichrist himself, for the sake of
religion.</p>

<p>This topic, I know, is much laboured by
the advocates of the papal cause, in order to
throw disgrace on Protestant writers, whom
they consider as so many incendiaries, wickedly
attempting to spread the flames of war through
Christian societies. There might be a time
when, in the case of some few men, transported
by passion, because outrageously oppressed,
there was, perhaps, some colour for this charge.
But to persist in it, as they still do, only
shews that they neither conceive with due reverence
of divine prophecy, nor do justice to
that spirit of toleration by which the Protestant
churches, at least of our days, are so eminently
distinguished.</p>

<p>III. “A <i>third</i> prejudice, which operates in
the minds of many persons against the principle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
under consideration, arises from the disagreeing
opinions of learned men concerning
the sense and application of the prophecies;
while not only the papal Divines, but many
writers of note even among ourselves, have
strenuously maintained that the church of
Rome is no way concerned in the predictions
concerning Antichrist.”</p>

<p>To this prejudice, I observe,</p>

<p>1. That arguments from authority, in all
cases where reason and good sense must finally
decide, are very little to be regarded. Shew
me the question in religion, or even in common
morals, about which learned men have
not disagreed; nay, shew me a single text of
scripture, though ever so plain and precise,
which the perverseness or ingenuity of interpreters
has not drawn into different, and often
contrary meanings. What then shall we conclude?
That there is no truth in religion, no
certainty in morals, no authority in sacred
scripture? If such conclusions, as these, be
carried to their utmost length, in what else
can they terminate, but absolute universal
scepticism?</p>

<p>2. I observe that this authority, after all,
whatever weight we may, in the general, suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
it to have, is, in the present case, no
great matter; for it is, in effect, but the authority
of <small>ONE</small> man, whose eminent worth,
however, and lustre of reputation, made it
current with some others.</p>

<p>The character of <span class="smcap">Hugo Grotius</span> is well
known. He is justly esteemed among the
ablest and most learned men of an age, that
abounded in ability and learning. Besides his
other shining talents, his acquaintance with
history was extensive; and his knowledge of
scripture, profound. And yet, with two such
requisites for unlocking the true sense of the
prophetic writings, this excellent man undertook
to prove in form, <i>That the Pope was not
Antichrist</i>.</p>

<p>The account of this mischance, is as extraordinary,
as the mischance itself. The moral
qualities of Grotius were still more admirable,
than his intellectual: and in these qualities,
we shall find the true spring of his unhappy
and misapplied pains on the subject before us.</p>

<p>He was in his own nature just, candid, benevolent,
to a supreme degree; and the experience
of an active turbulent life had but fortified
him the more in a love of these pacific
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
virtues. He was, on principle, a sincere and
zealous Christian; and consequently impressed
with a due sense of that exalted charity, which
is the characteristic of that religion: but he
had seen and felt much of the mischiefs, which
proceed from theological quarrels: and thus
every thing concurred to make him a friend to
peace, and, above all, to peace among Christians.</p>

<p>An union of the Catholic and Protestant
churches seemed necessary to this end: and
the apparent candour, whether real or affected,
of some learned persons, whom he had long
known and valued in the church of Rome,
drew him into the belief, that such a project
was not impracticable. Henceforth, it became
the ruling object of his life; and, permitting
himself too easily to conclude, that the
Protestant doctrine of Antichrist was the sole,
or principal obstruction to the union desired,
he bent all the efforts of his wit and learning to
discredit and overthrow that doctrine.</p>

<p>Thus, was this virtuous man betrayed by
the wisdom and equity of his own character;
and I know not if the observation of the moral
poet can be so justly applied to any other&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Insani sapiens nomen ferat, &aelig;quus iniqui,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ultr&agrave; qu&agrave;m satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The issue of his general scheme was what
might easily be foreseen: and of his <i>arguments</i>,
I shall only say thus much, That the
Romish writers themselves, for whose use they
might seem to be invented, though they continue
to object his name to us, are too wise to
venture the stress of their cause upon them.</p>

<p>To conclude this head of authority, let me
just observe,</p>

<p>3. In the last place, that, if any regard be
due to it, the advantage will clearly be on our
side. For, though the name of Grotius made
an impression on some Protestant interpreters
of scripture, not inconsiderable for their parts
and learning, yet, when the grounds of his
opinion came to be examined, the most and the
ablest of them have generally declared against
him: and among these, let it be no offence to
the manes of this great<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> man, if we particularly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
mention <small>TWO</small>, and prefer even to his authority
that of Newton and Clarke; the one, the
ablest philosopher, and the other, the coolest
and most rational divine, that any age has produced.</p>

<p>IV. “Another, and <i>fourth</i> prejudice may
have been entertained on this subject from observing
that many curious persons, who have
employed themselves much and long in the
study of the prophecies, especially of those
concerning Antichrist, have been led (on their
authority, as they pretend) to fix the time and
other circumstances of great events, which yet
have not fallen out agreeable to their expectations.
Whence it is inferred, that no solid information
can be derived from the prophecies,
and that all our reasonings upon them are no
better than fancy and conjecture.”</p>

<p>Now, though the indiscretion of these curious
persons, who would needs prophecy when
their business was only to interpret<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>, be injurious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
enough to their own character, I do not
see how it affects that of the prophets; unless
whatever may be abused (as every thing may)
be answerable for the abuses made of it. But
to reply more directly to this charge.</p>

<p>The ill success of men in explaining prophecies
of events, not yet come to pass, can in no
degree discredit those prophecies, unless it be
essential to this sort of revelation to be so
clearly proposed, as that it may and must be
perfectly understood, before those events happen;
the contrary of which I have already
shewn, in a preceding discourse. The very
idea of prophecy is that of <i>a light shining in a
dark place</i>: and a place is not <i>dark</i>, if we
have light enough to discern distinctly and
fully every remote corner of it. But the thing
speaks itself. For to what end is the prediction
delivered in obscure and enigmatic terms,
if the purpose of the inspirer was that the subject
of the prediction should be immediately,
and in all its circumstances, precisely apprehended?
Why, then, is any distinction made
between Prophecy, and History? The mode
of writing clearly demonstrates, that something,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
for a time at least, was meant to be
concealed from us: and then, if men will attempt,
out of season, to penetrate this mystery,
what wonder if mistake be the fruit of their
presumption?</p>

<p>Again: the <i>declared</i> end of prophecy is, not
that we may be enabled by it to foresee things
before they come to pass, but <i>when</i> they come
to pass, that we may acknowledge the divine
author of the prophecy<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>. What dishonour,
then, can it be to the prophet, that he is not
perfectly understood, till we be expected to
make use of his information? Nay, in the
case before us, it would dishonour him, if he
was. For, of the prophecies concerning Antichrist
we are expressly told, that they are <i>shut
up and sealed, till the time of the end</i>; that
is, till Time brings the key along with him.
So that, if men could open them, by their own
wit and sagacity only, they would give the lye
to the prophet. And thus we see, that the
very mistakes of interpreters attempting prematurely
to unfold the <i>sealed</i> prophecies concerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
Antichrist, far from subverting, support
the credit of those prophecies<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>.</p>

<p>But I have something more to say on this
subject. Though we cannot see every thing in
the prophecies, which we are impatient to see,
it is not to be supposed that we can see
nothing in them. If this were the case, we
should scarce regard them as prophecies at all;
at least, we should hardly be prevailed upon to
read and consider them. For, it is on the supposition
that some <i>light</i> is communicated to
us, that we are disposed, as well as required,
to <i>take heed to it</i>. In short, if we saw nothing,
we should expect nothing: such prophecies
would not engage our curiosity, or so
much as take our attention. In one word, they
would be utterly lost upon us.</p>

<p>This seems to have been, in some measure,
the case with regard to this very book of the
<i>Revelations</i>. The early Christians saw so little
in this prophecy, that they were led by degrees
to neglect the study of it. Otherwise,
the little they did see, might have given them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
a glimpse, at least, of many things, that intimately
concerned both their faith and conduct.</p>

<p>It being then necessary, as I said, that prophecy
should, from the first, convey some
light to us, and time having now very much
increased that light, it follows, that men may
excuseably employ themselves in studying and
contemplating even unfulfilled prophecies.
They may conjecture modestly of points which
time has not yet revealed: but they should, in
no case, pronounce confidently, or decide dogmatically
upon them.</p>

<p>It seems therefore to be going too far, to
pass an indiscriminate censure on all those,
who have proposed their thoughts on the sense
of prophecies, not yet completed, though it be
ever so clear that a wrong construction has
been made of them. Nay, it is worth considering
whether they may not even have conjectured
right, when they have been thought to
mistake the most widely. I say this, chiefly,
with regard to the <i>time</i>, which some writers
have beforehand assigned for the accomplishment
of certain prophecies, and that, on principles
apparently contained in those prophecies;
but so unhappily, as to draw much scorn
and ridicule upon themselves.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<p>I explain myself by a famous instance. Nothing
has been more censured in Protestant
divines, than their temerity in fixing <i>the fall
of Antichrist</i>; though there are certain data in
the prophecies, from which very probable conclusions
on that subject may be drawn. Experience,
it is said, contradicts their calculation.
But it is not considered, that the fall of
Antichrist, is not <i>a single event</i>, to happen all
at once; but <i>a state of things</i>, to continue
through a long tract of time, and to be gradually
accomplished. Hence, the interpretation of
the prophecy might be rightly formed, though
the expectations of most men are disappointed.</p>

<p>It is visible, I suppose, that the papal power
(if we agree to call that, <i>Antichrist</i>) is now on
the decline; whensoever that declension began,
or how long soever it may be, before it will be
finished. And therefore interpreters may have
aimed right, though they seemed to others,
and perhaps to themselves, to be mistaken.</p>

<p>Suppose, the ruin of the Western Empire
had been the subject of a prediction, and some
had collected, beforehand, from the terms of
the prophecy, that it would happen at a <i>particular</i>
time; when yet nothing more, in fact,
came to pass, than <i>the first irruption of the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
<i>barbarous nations</i>. Would it be certain that
this collection was groundless and ill made,
because the empire subsisted in a good degree
of vigour for some centuries after? Might it
not be said, that the empire <i>was falling</i><a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> from
that &aelig;ra, or perhaps before; though, in the
event, it <i>fell</i> not, till its sovereignty was shaken
by the rude hands of Attila, or rather, till it
was laid flat by the well-directed force of
Theodoric?</p>

<p>But we have an instance in point, recorded
in sacred scripture. It had been gathered from
the old prophecies<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>, that, <i>in the last times</i>,
(that is, when the Messiah was come) <i>a new
earth and new heavens should be created</i>. The
style is symbolical; but the meaning is, and
was so understood to be, that a new Law should
be given to mankind and prevail over the
whole world. This Law was accordingly promulged
and began to prevail in the days of the
Apostles. Yet there were some who said,
<i>Where is the promise of his coming? for, since
the fathers fell asleep, all things continue, as
they were from the creation of the world.</i> It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
was taken for granted, we see, that this great
and glorious work, equivalent to the production
of a new world, would take place suddenly
and at once; which not being the case, it
seemed to follow, that the prophecies were
false, or at least ill understood: when yet,
surely, they were then fulfilling under the eyes
of these <i>scoffers</i>.</p>

<p>It will be considered, how far these hints
may go towards rescuing some respectable interpreters
(for I speak only of such) from that
contempt, which has fallen upon them, and,
from them, on the prophecies themselves, for
some hazardous conclusions, or, (if you will)
predictions, formed and given out by them,
concerning the reign and fall of Antichrist.
My meaning, however, is not to make myself
responsible for these conclusions. They may
not be rightly drawn from the premises, laid
down; or the premises may be such, that the
precise date of those transactions cannot be determined
from them, at least, not, till the scene
of prophecy be closed, or, in the prophetic
language, <i>till the mystery of God be finished</i><a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>.
In the mean time, it is not clear and undeniable
that there is no ground at all for such conjectures:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
or, if it were, it would only follow
that they, who made them, had been rash and
indiscreet in commenting too minutely and
confidently on prophecies unfulfilled; and it
would be weak, as we have seen, to contract a
prejudice against the subject itself from the
mistakes of such commentators.</p>

<p>V. After all, the main and master prejudice,
I doubt, is, that levity of mind which disposes
too many to take their notions on this, and
other subjects of moment, from certain polite
and popular, it may be, but frivolous and libertine
writers: men, who have no religion, or
not enough to venerate the prophetic scriptures;
who have no knowledge, or certainly
not enough to understand them.</p>

<p>But with such cavillers, as these, I have no
concern; this Lecture, and the subject of it,
being addressed to men of another character,
to fair, candid, sober, and enlightened inquirers,
only: For so the inspired person, who first announced
these wonders concerning Antichrist,
to mankind, expressly declares, or rather prophesies&mdash;<i>None
of the wicked shall understand:

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> recounting the various prejudices, which
have diverted many persons from giving a due
attention to the prophecies concerning Antichrist,
I may be thought to have overlooked
<small>ONE</small> of the most considerable; which ariseth
from <i>the peculiar style, in which they are delivered</i>.
But this being a subject of larger
compass, and nicer inquiry, than the rest, (in
which, too, the credit of all the prophetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
scriptures, as well as those respecting Antichrist,
is concerned) I have purposely reserved
it for a distinct and separate examination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Without doubt</span>, a plain man, brought up
in our customs and notions, and unacquainted
with theological studies, when he first turns
himself to the contemplation of the Jewish and
Christian prophecies, will be surprised, perhaps
disgusted, to find, that he understands little,
or nothing of them. His <i>modesty</i> may incline
him to think, that such writings are too mysterious
for his comprehension: or, his <i>laziness
and presumption</i> may dispose him to reject
them, at once, as perfectly unintelligible; to
consider the language of them, as a jargon, to
which no ideas are annexed; or, at least, as a
kind of cypher, of so wild and fanatical a texture,
that no clear and certain construction can
be made of it.</p>

<p>Now, this prejudice, whichever way it
points, will be obviated, if it can be shewn,</p>

<p>1. That the prophetic style was of common
and approved use, in the times when the prophecies
were delivered, and among the people
to whom they were addressed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>

<p>And</p>

<p>2. That this style, how dark or fanciful soever
it may appear, is yet <i>reducible to rule</i>;
that is, is constructed on such principles, as
make it the subject of just criticism and reasonable
interpretation; and, in particular, to
us, at this day.</p>

<p>For a language is not <i>fanatical</i>, that is authorised
by general practice; nor can it be
deemed <i>unintelligible</i>, when it is capable of
having its meaning ascertained.</p>

<p>I. The proof of these two points will most
conveniently be given together, in a deduction
of the causes, which produced the character of
the prophetic style.</p>

<p>That character, I believe, is truly given by
those who affirm, That the style of the prophets
was only the poetical, and highly figurative
style of the Eastern nations. But if you
go farther and ask, How it came to pass, that
the oriental poetry was so much more figurative
than ours, it may not be enough to say, as
many others have done, that this difference of
character was owing to the influence of the sun,
and to the superior heat and fervour, which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
gave to an eastern imagination. For I know
not whether there be reason to think, that the
sun hath any such effect on the powers of the
mind; or that the fancies of men are apter to
catch, and blaze out in metaphor, within a
warm climate, than a cold one: a figurative
cast of style being observable in the native
poetry of all countries; and that, so far as appears
from history and experience, in a pretty
equal degree.</p>

<p>Besides, if the fact were allowed, the answer
would scarce be sufficient. For, as we shall
presently see, the symbolic language of Prophecy,
is too consistent and uniform, hath too
much of art and method in it, to be derived
from the casual flights and sallies of the imagination
<i>only</i>, how powerfully soever you suppose
it to have operated in the prophets.</p>

<p>We then must go much deeper for a true account
of the emblematic and highly coloured
expression, which glares so strongly in the prophetic
scriptures: and we shall find it, partly,
in the nature of the human mind; and, partly,
in the genius, indeed, of the oriental nations,
and especially of the Jews, but as fashioned,
not by the influence of their climate, but by
the modes of their learning and institution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

<p>I must be as brief as possible, on a subject,
which many learned writers<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> have largely and
fully discussed; and, as the reflexions I have
to offer to you upon it, are chiefly taken from
them, I may the rather bespeak your attention
to what follows.</p>

<p>1. First, then, let it be observed, that the
original language of all nations is extremely
imperfect. Their stock of words being small,
they explain themselves very much by <i>signs</i>,
or representative actions: and their conceptions,
in that early state of society, being gross
and rude, the few words they have, are replete
with material images, and so are what
we call highly metaphorical; and this, not
from choice or design, or even from any extraordinary
warmth of fancy, but of necessity, and
from the very nature of things.</p>

<p>Such is the primitive character of all languages:
and it continues long in all, because
the figurative manner is thought ornamental,
when it is no longer necessary; and because
the necessity of it is only, if at all, removed
by long use and habit in abstract speculation:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
a degree of refinement, to which the orientals,
and the Jews especially, never attained. And
therefore in their languages, very long</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Manserunt, hodieque manent vestigia ruris.</i><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus far we may go in accounting for the
figured style of the east, from general principles.
But this is by no means the whole of
the case. For</p>

<p>2. We are to reflect, that, before an alphabet
was invented, and what we call literary
writing was formed into an art, men had no
way to record their conceptions, or to convey
them to others at a distance, but by setting
down the figures and shapes of such things, as
were the objects of their contemplation. Hence,
the way of writing in <i>picture</i>, was as universal,
and almost as early, as the way of speaking in
<i>metaphor</i>; and from the same reason, the necessity
of the thing.</p>

<p>In process of time, and through many successive
improvements, this rude and simple
mode of <i>picture-writing</i> was succeeded by that
of <i>symbols</i>, or was enlarged at least, and enriched
by it. By symbols, I mean certain representative
marks, rather than express pictures;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
or if pictures, such as were at the same
time <i>characters</i>, and, besides presenting to the
eye the resemblance of a particular object,
suggested a general idea to the mind. As,
when a <i>horn</i> was made to denote <i>strength</i>, an
<i>eye and scepter</i>, <i>majesty</i>, and in numberless
such instances; where the picture was not
drawn to express merely the thing itself, but
something else, which was, or was conceived
to be, analogous to it. This more complex and
ingenious form of picture-writing was much
practised by the Egyptians, and is that which
we know by the name of <small>HIEROGLYPHICS</small>.</p>

<p>Indeed, these <i>symbolic characters</i> were
likely, in a course of successive refinements,
to pass into characters by <i>institution</i>: and
have, in fact, undergone that change among
the Chinese: and it might be expected that
<i>both</i> would be laid aside by any people that
should come to be acquainted with the far more
convenient and expeditious method of alphabetic
writing. But the event, in some instances,
hath been different. The Chinese
adhere to their <i>characters</i>, though from their
late intercourse with the European nations,
one cannot but suppose, that the knowledge of
<i>letters</i> has been conveyed to them: and the
Egyptians, through all the extent of their long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
subsisting and highly polished empire, retained
their <i>hieroglyphics</i>, notwithstanding their invention
and use of an <i>alphabet</i>.</p>

<p>Their inducement to this practice might be,
the pleasure they took in a mode of writing,
which gratified their inventive curiosity in
looking into the natures and analogies of things;
or, it might be a strain of policy in them to
secrete by this means, their more important
discoveries from the vulgar; or, vanity might
put them on raising the value of their knowledge
by wrapping it up in a vehicle, so amusing
at the same time, and mysterious.</p>

<p>What account soever be given of it, the fact
is, that the Egyptians cultivated the hieroglyphic
species of writing, with peculiar diligence;
while the antiquity, the splendor, the fame of
that mighty kingdom excited a veneration for
it, in the rest of the world. Hence it came to
pass, that the learning of those times, which
was spread from Egypt, as from its center,
took a strong tincture of the hieroglyphic spirit.
The East was wholly infected by it; so that it
became the pride of its wise men to try the
reach of each other’s capacity by questions conceived
and proposed in this form. Even the
Greeks, in much later ages, caught the manner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
of symbolizing their conceptions from
Egypt; and either drew their mythology from
that quarter, or dressed it out in the old Egyptian
garb. But the Israelites, especially, who
had their breeding in that country, at the time
when the hieroglyphic learning was at its
height, carried this treasure with them, among
their other <i>spoils</i>, into the land of Canaan.
And, though it be credible that their great
Law-giver interdicted the use of hieroglyphic
characters, yet the ideas of them were deeply
imprinted on their minds, and came out, on
every occasion, in those symbols and emblems,
with which, under the names of <i>riddles</i>, <i>parables</i>,
and <i>dark sayings</i>, their writings are so
curiously variegated and imbossed.</p>

<p>This then is the true and proper account of
that peculiar style, which looks so strangely,
and to those, who do not advert to this original
of it, perhaps so fantastically, in the writings
of the prophets. And what more natural, than
that a mode of expression, which was so well
known, so commonly practised, and so much
revered; which was effected by the wittiest,
nay, by the wisest men of those times; which
was employed in the theology of the Eastern
world, in its poetry, its philosophy, and all
the sublimer forms of composition; What
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
wonder, I say, that this customary, this authorized,
this admired strain of language should
be that in which the sacred writers conveyed
their highest and most important revelations to
mankind?</p>

<p>Nor let any man take offence at the condescension
of the divine Inspirer, as though he
degraded himself, by his compliance with the
humours and fancies of those to whom his inspirations
were addressed. For let him reflect,
that in what form of words soever it shall please
God to communicate himself to man, it must
still be in a way, that implies the utmost, indeed
the same, condescension to our weaknesses
and infirmities; nay, that immediate inspiration
itself, though coming through no medium
of language, is of necessity to be accommodated
to our methods of perceiving and understanding,
how imperfect soever they are.</p>

<p>Besides, if external revelation be possible, it
must be given in some one mode of speech or
writing, in preference to others. And, if we
consider how ancient, how general, how widely
diffused, this symbolic style has been, and still
is, in the world; how necessary it is to rude
nations, and how taking with the most refined;
how large a proportion of the globe this practice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
had over-run before, and at the time of
writing the prophecies, and what vast regions
of the South and East, not yet professing the
faith, but hereafter, as we presume, to be enlightened
by it, the same practice, at this day,
overspreads; when we consider all this, we
shall cease perhaps to admire, that the style in
question was adopted, rather than any other;
or we shall only admire the divine goodness
and wisdom of its Author, who had contrived
beforehand, in the very form of this revelation,
what may possibly help to bring on
and facilitate the reception of it. Certainly, it
may become us, on such an occasion, to enlarge
our ideas a little; and not to conclude
hastily and peremptorily that, when a general
blessing was intended by Providence, the mode
of conveying it should be instituted singly with
an eye to our local notions and confined prejudices,
and with no regard to the more prevailing
sentiments and expectations of mankind.</p>

<p>In the mean time, it is past a doubt that the
hieroglyphic style was predominant in the ancient
world; in Jud&aelig;a, particularly, from the
times of Moses to the coming of Christ.
There was indeed a degree of obscurity in it,
so far at least as to furnish the Jews, who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
no mind to listen to their Prophets, with a
pretence of not understanding them (as we see
from the complaint brought against the prophet
Ezekiel in the text, <i>Doth he not speak
Parables?</i>) yet still, it cannot be denied,
<i>That this mode of writing was of common and
approved use in the ages, when the prophecies
were delivered, and among the people, to
whom they were addressed</i>.</p>

<p>Our <small>FIRST</small> proposition is then reasonably
made out; and so much of the <small>SECOND</small>, as affirms
that the prophetic style <i>is constructed on
such principles as make it the subject of just
criticism and rational interpretation</i>. For it
was constructed, as we have seen, on the symbolic
principles of the hieroglyphics; which
were not vague uncertain things; but fixed and
constant analogies, determinable in their own
nature, or from the steady use that was made
of them. And a language, formed on such
principles, may be reasonably interpreted upon
them. So that what remains is only to shew,
that there <i>are</i> means, by which this abstruse
language may become intelligible to us, at this
day.</p>

<p>II. That there are such means, you will
easily collect, without requiring me to come to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
a detail on so immense a subject, from the
following considerations.</p>

<p>1. Some light may be expected to arise from
the study of the prophecies themselves. For
the same symbols, or figures, recur frequently
in those writings: and, by comparing one passage
with another; the darker prophecies with
the more perspicuous; the unfulfilled, with
such as have been completed; and those which
have their explanation annexed to them, with
those that have not; by this course of inquiry,
I say, there is no doubt but some considerable
progress may be made in fixing the true and
proper meaning of this mysterious language.</p>

<p>2. Very much of the Egyptian hieroglyphics,
on which, as we have seen, the prophetic style
was fashioned, may be learned from many ancient
records and monuments, still subsisting;
and from innumerable hints and passages, scattered
through the Greek antiquaries and historians,
which have been carefully collected and
compared by learned men.</p>

<p>3. The Pagan superstitions of every form
and species, which were either derived from
Egypt, or conducted on hieroglyphic notions,
have been of singular use in commenting on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
the Jewish prophets. Their Omens, Augury,
and Judicial Astrology seem to have proceeded
on symbolic principles; the mystery being
only this, That such objects, as in the hieroglyphic
pictures, were made the symbols of
certain ideas, were considered as omens of the
things themselves. Thus, the figure of a <i>horse</i>,
being the symbol of prosperity and success in
arms, when a <i>head</i> of this animal was found in
laying the foundations of Carthage, the Soothsayers
concluded, that the character of that
state would be warlike, and its fortune prosperous:
or, thus again, because the <i>sun</i> was
the common emblem of a King, or supreme
governor in any state, an <i>eclipse</i> of this luminary
was thought to indicate the ruin, or diminution,
at least, of his power and fortune; and
the superstition is not quite extinct at this
day<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>.</p>

<p>But, of all the Pagan superstitions, that
which is known by the name of <i>Oneirocritics</i>,
or the art of interpreting dreams, is most directly
to our purpose. There is a curious treatise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
on this subject, which bears the name of
Achmet, an Arabian writer; and another by
Artemidorus, an Ephesian, who lived about
the end of the first century<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>. In the former of
these collections (for both works are compiled
out of preceding and very ancient writers) the
manner of interpreting dreams, according to the
use of the Oriental nations, is delivered; as the
rules, which the Gr&aelig;cian diviners followed, are
deduced in the other. For, light and frivolous
as this art was, it is not to be supposed that it
was taken up at hazard, or could be conducted
without rule; an arbitrary or capricious interpretation
of dreams, considered as a mode of
divination, being too gross an insult on the
common sense of mankind<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>. But the rules,
by which both the Greek and Oriental diviners
justified their interpretations, appear to have
been formed on symbolic principles, that is, on
the very same ideas of analogy, by which the
Egyptian hieroglyphics (now grown venerable,
and even sacred) were explained. So that the
prophetic style, which is all over painted with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
hieroglyphic imagery, receives an evident illustration
from these two works.</p>

<p>I have said, that this superstition was <i>more
immediately to our purpose, than any other</i>.
For some of the more important prophecies are
delivered in the way of dreams; and therefore,
without doubt, the rules for interpreting the
symbols presented to the mind of the prophet
in these inspired dreams, were the very same
with those, that were laid down in the Gentile
Oneirocritics. The conclusion, I know, may
appear bold and hazardous. But you will reflect
that there is really nothing more strange in
applying this mode of interpretation to <i>dreams</i>,
than to any other species of prophecy; to visions,
for instance, or parables, or even, in general,
to any part of the prophetic style. The
compliance, on the part of the inspirer, is the
same on every supposition; and only shews
that, when the Deity thinks fit to reveal himself
to men, he does it in a way that is suitable to
their ideas and apprehensions. Nor is any sanction,
in the mean time, given, by this accommodation
of himself, to the pagan practice of divining
by dreams. For, though the same symbols
be interpreted in the same manner, yet the
<i>prophecy</i> doth not depend on the interpretation,
but the inspiration of the dream. A casual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
dream, thus interpreted, is only a dream still;
the received sense of the symbols, represented
in it, no way inferring the completion of it.
But when the Almighty sends the dream, the
symbols are of another consideration, and not
only signify, but <i>predict</i>, an event.</p>

<p>Now, if men will mistake a <i>barely significant
emblem</i>, for <i>a prophetic inspiration</i>, the
fault is in themselves, and not in the use of the
common emblems; which may be the vehicle
of a true prophecy, though craft or superstition
take occasion from them to <i>divine lies</i><a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>. It
follows, that the rules, which the ancient diviners
observed in explaining symbolic dreams,
may be safely and justly applied to the interpretation
of symbolic prophecies, and especially
to such of them as were delivered in the form
of dreams.</p>

<p>4. It is lastly to be observed, that not only
the Arabic and other Oriental writers, but even
the Greek and Latin poets, may contribute very
much to the exposition of the ancient prophets.
For these poets abound in strong metaphors
and glowing images, which were either copied
from the symbolic language of the East, or invented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
on the same principles of analogy as
prevailed in the Egyptian hieroglyphics. So
that many expressions, which seem dark and
strange in the writings of the Jewish prophets,
may be clearly illustrated and familiarized to
us, even from classic usage and example.</p>

<p>And now from these several sources; that is,
from <i>the scriptures themselves</i>&mdash;from the still
<i>subsisting monuments of Egyptian hieroglyphics</i>&mdash;from
<i>the Gentile ceremonies and superstitions</i>&mdash;and
from <i>the greater works of
genius and fancy, transmitted to us both from
the Eastern and Western poets</i>&mdash;such a vocabulary
of the prophetic terms and symbols
may be, nay hath been<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>, drawn up, as serves
to determine the sense of them in the same
manner, as any common art or language is explained
by its own proper key, or dictionary;
and there is, in truth, no more difficulty in
fixing the import of the prophetic style, than
of any other language or technical phraseology
whatsoever.</p>

<p>III. But, if the case be so clear, you may
now be tempted to ask, “What then becomes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of the obscurity, in which the prophecies are
said to be involved; and in particular, how
comes it to pass, that they may not be as well
explained, before the completion, as after it<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>;
which yet is constantly denied by writers on
this subject, and, even, by your own principles,
cannot be supposed?”</p>

<p>To this objection, I shall not reply by saying,
That the style of the prophets, though
intelligible, yet requires much practice in the
interpreter to unfold its meaning; for that is
the case of many other arts and sciences, which
yet are generally understood: nor, that the
symbolic terms are frequently capable of several
senses, which must needs perplex the interpretation;
for there is no common language,
in which the plainest words do not frequently
admit the same difference of construction, which
yet creates no great difficulty to those who attend
closely to the scope of a writer: I shall
not therefore, I say, amuse you with these
evasive answers, but reply, directly to the purpose
of your inquiry, by observing,</p>

<p>“That there are several methods, or, if you
will, artifices, by which the inspired writers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
under the cover of a symbolic expression, and
sometimes even without it, might effectually
conceal their meaning, before the completion
of a prophecy, though the language, in which
they write, be clearly explicable on fixed and
stated rules.”</p>

<p>1. When the prophecy is of remote events,
the <i>subject</i> is frequently not announced, or
announced only in general terms. Thus, an
<i>earthquake</i> is described&mdash;a <i>mountain</i> is said
to be thrown down&mdash;a <i>star</i>, to fall from heaven;
and so in numberless other instances.
Now, an earthquake, in hieroglyphic language,
denotes a <i>revolution in government</i>; a mountain
is the symbol of a <i>kingdom</i>, or <i>capital
city</i>; a star, of <i>a prince</i>, or <i>great man</i>: but
of <i>what</i> government, of <i>what</i> kingdom, of <i>what</i>
prince, the prophet speaks, we are not told,
and are frequently unable to find out, till a full
coincidence of all circumstances, in the event,
discloses the secret.</p>

<p>2. The prophetic terms are not only figurative,
but sometimes, and in no common degree,
hyperbolical (of which the reason will be
given hereafter), so that nothing but the event
can determine the true size and value of them.
This seems to have been the case of those prophecies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
in the Old Testament, which describe
the tranquillity and felicity of Christ’s kingdom;
and may possibly be the case of those
prophecies in the New, which respect the Millennium.</p>

<p>3. It being the genius of the prophetic style
to be &aelig;nigmatical, this cast is sometimes purposely
given to it, even when the expression is
most plain and direct. Thus Jeremiah prophesies
of Zedekiah, king of Judah, <i>that he
should be delivered into the hands of the king
of Babylon, that his eyes should behold the
eyes of the king of Babylon, and that he should
go to Babylon</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>. Ezekiel, prophesying of the
same prince, says, <i>that he should go to Babylon,
but that he should not see it, though he
should die there</i><a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>. Now Josephus tells us,
that the apparent inconsistency of these two
prophecies determined Zedekiah to believe neither
of them. Yet both were strictly and
punctually fulfilled.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, the chief difficulty of all lies in
a circumstance, not much observed by interpreters,
and, from the nature of it, not <i>observable</i>,
till after the event; I mean, in <i>a mixed</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
<i>use of the plain and figured style</i>: so that the
prophetic descriptions are sometimes <i>literal</i>,
even when they appear most figurative; and
sometimes, again, they are highly <i>figurative</i>,
when they appear most plain. An instance of
<i>literal</i> expression, under the mask of figurative,
occurs in the prophet Nahum, who predicts
the overthrow of Nineveh in these words&mdash;<i>With
an over-running flood he will make an
utter end of the place thereof</i>, [Nahum i. 8.]
An <i>over-running flood</i>, is the hieroglyphic
symbol of <i>desolation by a victorious enemy</i>:
and in this highly figurative sense, an interpreter
of the prophecy would, in all likelihood,
understand the expression. But the event
shewed the sense to be literal; that city being
taken, as we know from history, by means of
an <i>inundation</i>. Of <i>figurative</i> expression, under
the form of literal, take the following instance
from a prophecy, of Christ himself; who
says to the Jews, <i>Destroy this temple, and I
will raise it up in three days</i>, [John i. 19.]
It was natural enough for the Jews to understand
our Lord as speaking of the <i>temple</i> at
Jerusalem; the rather, as this term had not
been, and, I think, could, not be, applied, to
any person, before Jesus: to <i>Him</i>, it might
be so applied; and we know that <i>he spake of
the temple of his body</i>, [ver. 21.]
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<p>The same equivocal use was, sometimes,
purposely made of <i>proverbial expressions</i>, as
learned men have observed<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>.</p>

<p>I omit many other causes of obscurity in the
prophecies; such as the seeming incredibility,
sometimes, of the things predicted&mdash;the undefined
chronology and geography&mdash;the intricacy
of the method&mdash;and many other considerations.
But you will collect from these brief
hints, respecting the <i>expression</i> only, that,
though the symbolic language be reducible to
rule, and therefore, in the main, sufficiently
intelligible, yet that there is room enough for
the introduction of so much obscurity into the
prophetic writings, as may answer the ends of
the inspirer, and conceal the full meaning of
them from the most sagacious interpreter, till
it be revealed, in due time, by the event.</p>

<p>Or, if it be thought that such difficulties as
the event removes, are not, in their own nature,
invincible, before it happens, it is still
to be considered, that the giver of the prophecy
is, by supposition, divine; and as he, therefore,
foresaw, in framing the texture of it, that
such difficulties would, in fact, be invincible,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
they served the purpose of a designed concealment
just as well, as if, in nature, they were.
Whence the conclusion is still the same, That
the prophetic style might be the cover of impenetrable
obscurities in a prophecy, before its
completion, and yet the terms of it be clearly
explicable on established rules; the event only
enabling the expositor more skilfully and properly
to apply those rules.</p>

<p>IV. To conclude this subject; It will now
be acknowledged, that the suspicions which
have been taken up against the prophetic way
of writing, as if it were vague, illusory, or unintelligible,
are utterly without foundation.
The style of the prophets was the known, authorized
style of their age and country, in all
writings especially, of a sacred or solemn character;
and is even yet in use with a great part
of mankind. It further appears, that, as it
was understood by those to whom it was addressed,
so the principles, on which it was
formed, are discoverable by many obvious methods,
and may be applied, with success, to
the interpretation of it, at this day.</p>

<p>The prophetic style is, then, a <i>sober and
reasonable</i> mode of expression. But this is
not all. We may, even, discern the <i>expediency</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
I had almost said, the <i>necessity</i>, of
this style, considered as the <i>medium</i>, or vehicle
of prophetic inspiration.</p>

<p>For we have seen, that the scheme of scriptural
prophecy extends through all time; and
is so contrived as to adumbrate future and
more illustrious events, in preceding and less
important transactions: a circumstance, which
shews the harmony and connexion of the
whole scheme, and is not imitable by any human
art, or forethought whatsoever. But now
a figurative style is so proper to that end,
that we scarcely conceive how it could be
accomplished by any other. For thus the expression
conforms, at once, to the type, and
antitype: it is, as it were, a robe of state, for
the one; and only, the ordinary, accustomed
dress of the other: as we may see from the
prophecies, which <i>immediately</i> respect the restoration
of the Jews from their ancient captivities,
and, <i>ultimately</i>, their final triumphant
return from their present dispersion&mdash;from
the prophecies concerning the destruction of
Jerusalem, which prefigure, at the same time,
the day of judgment&mdash;from those concerning
the first coming of Christ, which, also, set
forth his reign with the saints on earth, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
even the glories of his heavenly kingdom&mdash;and
in a multitude of other instances.</p>

<p>These successive, and so different, schemes
of Providence could only be signified <i>together</i>
in a mode of language, that contracted, or enlarged
itself, as the occasion required. But
such is the singular property of a symbolic
style. For none but this, hath fold and drapery
enough, if I may so speak, to invest the
<i>greater</i> subjects; while yet (so complying is
the texture of this expression) it readily adapts
itself to the <i>less considerable</i>, which it ennobles
only, and not disfigures. The difference
is, that what is a metaphor in the former
case, becomes an hyperbole in the latter.
And this double use of the same symbol, is
the true account of such figures as are thought
most extravagant in the description of the prophets.</p>

<p>We see, then, in every view, how reasonable,
how expedient, how divine, the symbolic
style is, in such writings as the prophetic.
So that if any be disposed, in our days, to
take up the complaint of the text, and to up-braid
the prophets by asking, <i>Do they not
speak Parables?</i> We may now take courage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
to answer, Yes: but <i>parables</i>, which, as dark
as they are accounted to be, may be well understood;
and, what is more, <i>parables</i>, which
are so expressed, as to carry an evidence in
themselves that they <i>are</i> what they assume to
be, of divine inspiration.

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">All</span> the prophecies of the Old and New
Testament are written in <i>parables</i>; that is, in
highly figurative terms; which yet, on examination,
have appeared to be explicable on
certain fixed and rational grounds of criticism.</p>

<p>So far, therefore, as any prejudice may have
been entertained against the prophecies concerning
Antichrist, as if the language of them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
were too abstruse or fanciful to be understood,
enough hath been already said to shew, that it
is not well founded.</p>

<p>It must, however, be confessed, that the
book of <i>Revelations</i><a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>, which contains the most,
and the chief prophecies on the subject of Antichrist,
is of a deeper and more mysterious
contrivance, than any other of the prophetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
writings. Whence, our next step, in this inquiry,
must be, To trace the <small>CAUSES</small> of that
peculiar obscurity; and to suggest, as we go
along, the <small>MEANS</small>, by which it hath been, or
may be, removed.</p>

<p>The <i>causes</i>, are to be sought in the <small>STYLE</small>,
and the <small>METHOD</small>, of that book. I say nothing
of the <i>subject</i>; for, though the <i>things predicted</i>
may darken a prophecy, unfulfilled, the
<i>event</i> will shew what they are; and it is not
necessary, that we should anxiously inquire
into the meaning of a prophecy, till it be accomplished.</p>

<p>I. <i>First</i>, then, the <small>STYLE</small> of the Revelations
(for I mean not to consider it, with regard to
the Greek tongue, in which it is composed, or,
to the Hebrew idiom, with which it is coloured)
The <i>style</i>, I say, being symbolical,
like that of the other prophecies, must, in
general, be explained on the same principles,
that is, must be equally intelligible, in both.
Yet, if we attend nicely to the style of this
prophecy, some difference will be found, in
<i>the choice of the symbols</i>, and in <i>the continuity
of the symbolic form</i>.</p>

<p>1. To explain my meaning, on the first article,
I must observe, That, though the prophetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
style abounds in <i>hieroglyphic</i> symbols,
properly so called, yet the Israelites, when
they adopted that style, did not confine themselves
to the old Egyptian stock of symbols;
but, working on the same ground of analogy,
superadded many others, which their own
circumstances and observations suggested to
them. Their divine ritual, their civil customs,
their marvellous history, and even
the face and aspect of their country, afforded
infinite materials for the construction of fresh
symbols: and these, when they came into
common use, their prophets freely and largely
employed. Thus, <i>incense</i>, from the religious
use of it in the Mosaical service, denotes
<i>prayer</i>, or <i>mental adoration</i><a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>&mdash;<i>to tread a
wine-press</i>, from their custom of pressing
grapes, signifies <i>destruction, attended with
great slaughter</i><a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>&mdash;<i>to give water in the wilderness</i>,
in allusion to the miraculous supply
of that element, during the passage of the
Israelites through the wilderness to the holy
land, is the emblem of <i>unexpected relief in
distress</i><a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>;&mdash;and, to mention no more, a <i>forest</i>,
such as Lebanon, abounding in lofty cedars,
represents a <i>great city, with its flourishing
ranks of inhabitants</i><a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>; just as, a <i>mountain</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
from the situation of the Jewish temple on
mount Moria, is made to stand for the <i>Christian
Church</i><a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>.</p>

<p>Now, though the symbols of this class be
occasionally dispersed through the old prophets,
yet they are more frequent, and much
thicker sown, in the Revelations: so that to a
reader, not well versed in the Jewish story and
customs, this difference may add something to
the obscurity of the book.</p>

<p>If you ask the <i>reason</i> of this difference, it is
plainly this. The scene of the apocalyptic visions
is laid, not only in Jud&aelig;a, but in the
temple at Jerusalem; whence the imagery is,
of course, taken. It was natural for the writer
to draw his allusions from Jewish objects,
and especially from the ceremonial of the temple-service.
Besides, the declared scope of the
prophecy being to predict the fortunes of the
Christian church, what so proper as to do this
under the cover of Jewish ideas; the law itself,
as we have before seen, and as St. Paul
expressly tells us, having been so contrived, as
to present the <i>shadow</i> of that future dispensation?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>This then (and for the reason assigned) is
<small>ONE</small> distinguishing character of the Apocalyptic
style. But the difficulty of interpretation, arising
from it, cannot be considerable; or, if it
be, may be overcome by an obvious method,
by a careful study of the Jewish history and
law.</p>

<p>2. The <small>OTHER</small> mark of distinction, which I
observed in the style of this book, is the <i>continuity</i>
of the symbolic manner. Parables are
frequent, indeed, in the old prophets, but interspersed
with many passages of history, and
have very often their explanation annexed.
This great parable of St. John is, throughout,
carried on in its own proper form, without any
such interruption, and, except in <i>one</i> instance<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>,
without any express interpretation of the parabolic
terms.</p>

<p>Now, the prophecy, no doubt, must be considerably
obscured by this circumstance. But
then let it be considered, that we have proportionable
<i>means</i> of understanding it. For, if
the symbols be continued, they are still but
the <i>same</i><a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>, as had been before in use with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
elder prophets; whose writings, therefore, are
the proper and the certain key of the <i>Revelations</i>.</p>

<p>From these distinctive characters, then, of
the Apocalyptic style<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>, nothing more can be
inferred, than the necessity of studying <i>the
Law, and the Prophets</i>, in order to understand
the language of this last and most mysterious
revelation. And what is more natural,
nay what can be thought more divine, than
that, in a system, composed of two dependent
dispensations, the study of the former should
be made necessary to the comprehension of the
latter; and that the very uniformity of style
and colouring, in the two sets of prophecies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
should admonish us of the intimate connexion,
which each has with the other, to the end
that we might the better conceive the meaning,
and fathom the depth, of the divine councils
in <i>both</i>?</p>

<p>But, without speculating further on the final
purposes of this Judaical and Symbolical character,
so strongly impressed on the Apocalypse,
it must evidently appear that the difficulties of
interpretation, occasioned by it, are not invincible;
nay, that, to an attentive and rightly
prepared interpreter, they will be scarce any
difficulties at all<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>I proceed, then,</p>

<p>II. To the <small>SECOND</small>, and more considerable
cause of the obscurities, found in this prophecy,
the <span class="smcap">Method</span>, in which it is composed.</p>

<p>The other prophecies have, doubtless, their
difficulties, arising from the abrupt manner, in
which, agreeably to the Oriental genius, they
are delivered: But then, being short and unconnected
with each other, the apparent disorder
of those prophecies, has rarely any sensible
effect in preventing the right application
of them. The case is different with the
prophecies, contained in this book. For, having
been all delivered at once, and respecting
a series of events, which were to come to pass
successively in the history of the Christian
Church, it is reasonable to expect that some
certain and determinable method should be observed
in the delivery of them; and the true
secret of that method, whatever it be, must
be investigated, before we can, with success,
apply any single prophecy to its proper subject.</p>

<p>The <i>first</i>, and most obvious expectation of
a reader is, that the events predicted in this
prophecy should follow each other in the order
of the prophecy itself, or that the series of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
visions should mark out and determine the
succession of the subjects, to which they relate.
But there is reason to think, on the face
of the prophecy, that this method is not observed.</p>

<p>A <i>second</i> conclusion would, then, be hastily
taken up, that there is no regular method at
all in these visions, but that each is to be applied
singly, and without any reference to the
rest, to such events as it might be found, in
some tolerable degree, to suit: And then it is
plain, that fancy would have too much scope
afforded her in the interpretation of these visions,
to produce any firm and settled conviction,
that they were rightly and properly applied.
Yet, as this idea of the Apocalypse
would favour the laziness, the precipitancy,
the presumption, and, very often, the malignity
of the human mind, it is no wonder that
it should be readily and eagerly embraced.
And, in fact, it was to this pre-conceived notion
of a general disorder in the texture of
these prophecies, that the little progress, which,
for many ages, had been made in the exposition
of them, is chiefly to be ascribed.</p>

<p>But then, <i>lastly</i>, if neither the order of the
prophecy be that of the events, nor a total disorder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
in the construction of it can be reasonably
allowed, the question is, By what <i>rules</i>
was it composed, and on what ideas of <i>method</i>
is it to be explained?</p>

<p>This question, as obvious as it seems, was
not presently asked; and, when it was asked,
not easily answered. The clear light, indeed,
which the Reformation had let in on some
parts bf this prophecy, and a spirit of inquiry,
which sprung up with the revival of Letters,
excited a general attention to this mysterious
book. But, as each interpreter brought his
own hypothesis along with him, the perplexities
of it were not lessened, but increased by
so many discordant schemes of interpretation:
And the issue of much elaborate inquiry was,
that the book itself was disgraced by the fruitless
efforts of its commentators, and on the
point of being given up, as utterly impenetrable,
when a sublime Genius arose, in the beginning
of the last century, and surprised the
learned world with that great desideratum, <i>A
Key to the Revelations</i>.</p>

<p>This extraordinary person was, <span class="smcap">Joseph
Mede</span>: of whose character it may not be improper
to give a slight sketch, before I lay before
you the substance of his discoveries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was a candid, sincere man; disinterested,
and unambitious; of no faction in religion or
government (both which began in his time to
be overrun with factions) but solely devoted to
the love of truth, and to the investigation of it.
His learning was vast, but well chosen and
well digested; and his understanding, in no
common degree, strong and capacious.</p>

<p>With these qualities of the head and heart,
he came to the study of the prophecies, and
especially of the Revelations: But, with so little
<i>bigotry</i> for the scheme of interpretation concerning
Antichrist, that, as he tells us himself,
<i>he had even conceived some prejudice against
it</i><a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>: And, what is stranger still in a man of his
inventive genius, with so little <i>enthusiasm</i> in
his temper for <i>any</i> scheme of interpretation
whatsoever, that, when he had made his great
discovery, he was in no haste to publish it to
the world<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>; and, when at length he did this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
he was still less in haste to apply it, that is, to
shew its important use in explaining the Apocalyptic
visions<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>. Cool, deliberate, and severe,
in forming his judgments, he was so far from
being obsequious to the fancies of other men,
that he was determined only, by the last degree
of evidence, to acquiesce in any conclusions
of his own<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>.</p>

<p>In short, with no <i>vanity</i> to indulge, (for he
was superior to this last infirmity of ingenious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
men<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>)&mdash;with no <i>interest</i> in view (for the interest
of Churchmen lay at that time, as he
well understood, in a different quarter<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>)&mdash;with
no <i>spleen</i> to gratify (for even neglect and solitude
could not engender this unmanly vice in
him<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>)&mdash;with no oblique purposes, I say,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
which so often mislead the pens of other
writers, but with the single, unmixed love of
truth, he dedicated his great talents to the
study of the prophetic Scriptures, and was able
to unfold, in the <small>MANNER</small> I am now to represent
to you, this mysterious prophecy of the
Revelations.</p>

<p>He had observed, that the miscarriage of
former interpreters had been owing, chiefly,
to a vain desire of finding their own sense in
this prophecy, rather than the sense of the
prophet. Laying aside, then, all hypotheses
whatsoever, he sate down to the book itself,
and resolved to know nothing more of it, than
what the frame and texture of its composition
might clearly reveal to him. He considered
the whole, as a naked recital of facts, literally
expressed; and not as a prophetic scheme,
mystically represented. In this way of inquiry,
he discerned, that several parts of the history,
whatever their secret and involved meaning
might be, were <i>homogeneous</i>, and <i>contemporary</i>;
that is, they related to the same subject,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
and were comprised within the same period;
and this, though they were not connected in
the order of the narration, but lay dispersed in
different quarters of it. These several sets of
historical passages (or, of <i>Visions</i>, to speak in
the language of the book itself) he carefully
analyzed and compared; shewed, from circumstances,
not imagined, but found, in the
history, their mutual relation and correspondency;
and established his conclusions, as he
went along, not in a loose way of popular conjecture,
but in the strictest forms of Geometric
reasoning. The coincident histories, thus
classed and scrutinized, he distinguished by
the name of <span class="smcap">Synchronisms</span>; and gave them to
the learned world, in this severe scientific form,
without further comment or illustration, under
the title of <span class="smcap">Clavis Apocalyptica</span>, or <span class="smcap">A Key
to the Revelations</span>.</p>

<p>In considering this discovery, which did so
much honour to the profound genius and accurate
investigation of its author, one clearly
perceives how it serves to the end proposed.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, it appears that the order of the
Visions is not that of the events; in other
words, that the prophecy is not to be so explained,
as if the events, predicted in it, followed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
each other in the same train as the Visions.
For the <i>facts</i>, which constitute the
scheme or fable of the prophecy, literally and
historically considered, do not succeed to each
other in that train; therefore the <i>events</i>, whatever
they may be, which those facts adumbrate,
most certainly cannot.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, it appears what the true, or chronological
order of the Visions, is; namely,
that, which the nature and connexion of the
things transacted in them, points out and declares.
So that, if the real time of any one
Vision can be shewn, the relative time of the
rest may be easily settled. For (to quote Mr.
Mede’s own words) <i>such Visions as contemporate
with that already ascertained, are of
course to be applied to the same times; while
such as, in the order of the story, precede
that Vision, are to be referred to preceding
events, and those, which follow it, are in like
manner to be explained of subsequent transactions</i><a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

<p>By this means, the whole plan or method
of the Apocalypse will be laid down. The
several synchronical prophecies will thus fall
in their proper places; and there will be no
doubt of the relative situation, which each
holds in the general system.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, as we now see the true order of the
prophecies (though for the wisest reasons, no
doubt, the order, in which they are delivered,
be sometimes different) so it is to be observed,
that the knowledge of this order is a great restraint
on the fancy of an expositor; who is
not now at liberty to apply the prophecies to
events of any time, to which they appear to
suit, but to events only falling within that
time, to which they belong in the course of
this pre-determined method. And if to this
restriction, which of itself is considerable, we
add <i>another</i>, which arises from the necessity
of applying, not one, but many prophecies
(which are, thus, shewn to synchronize with
each other) to the <i>same</i> time, we can hardly
conceive how an interpretation should keep
clear of these impediments, and make its way
through so many interfering checks, unless it
be the <i>true</i> one. Just as when a Lock (to
take the author’s allusion) is composed of many,
and intricate wards, the <i>Key</i>, that turns easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
within them, and opens the Lock, can only
be that which properly belongs to it.</p>

<p>After all, it may be difficult, I know, to
convey a distinct idea of the uses, to which this
synchronal method serves, to those who have
not read, and even studied, Mr. Mede’s work.
But the sum of the matter is this, That the
order of the events and of the Visions is <i>not</i>
the same&mdash;that the <i>true</i> order of the events, is
to be sought in certain characters, not fancied
at pleasure, but inserted, in the Visions themselves&mdash;and,
lastly, that the whole book of
the Revelations being thus resolvable into a
particular determinate order, in which the several
sets of synchronal prophecies regularly
succeed to each other, no exposition of this
book can be admitted, that does not refer every
single prophecy to its true place in the system,
and provide at the same time that no violence
be done to any other prophecies, which synchronize
with it.</p>

<p>And thus much concerning the <small>TRUE ORDER</small>
of the Apocalypse; deduced, you see, from no
precarious hypothetic reasonings, but from
notes and characters, inclosed in that book;
that is, from intrinsic arguments, which have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
their evidence in themselves, and conclude
alike on every supposition.</p>

<p>If we would know more distinctly what the
<small>EXTERIOR FORM</small> of it is; and how it comes to
differ so widely from the plan of a chronological
arrangement; here, too, our sagacious expositor
will give us satisfaction. For, in bringing
together and comparing his synchronisms,
he found (what had escaped the attention of
all others) that the main body of the prophecy
is made up of <small>TWO</small><a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> great parts; which are,
also, synchronical; so that, setting out from
the same goal, and measuring the same space,
they both concur in the same end: but with
this difference, that the <i>former</i> division more
immediately regards the affairs of the <i>Empire</i>;
the <i>latter</i>, those of the <i>Church</i>.</p>

<p>Still, this is not all. Our attentive and
penetrating commentator further discovered,
That the two great component parts of this
prophecy, though distinct, are very artificially
connected, and shewn to harmonize throughout
with each other, by making the same concluding
event<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>, once told, the catastrophe of both.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
For the <i>former</i> part is purposely, and with
express warning given<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>, left unfinished, till a
summary deduction of the <i>latter</i> part down to
the same point of time<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>, (by way of prelude
to the more extended visions of this last part,
which follow to the end of the book, and to
signify, that both parts are contemporary) furnished
the occasion of shutting up the two prophecies
together in one common term: which,
however, had the appearance of being misplaced,
till the detection of this singular contrivance,
by means of the synchronisms, pointed
out the use and end of the present disposition<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p><i>Another</i> cause of the seeming perplexity in
which this Prophecy is involved, is, That, it
being expedient to treat the same subject in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
different respects, and to give different views
of it, according as two sets of men, the true
worshipers and the false, were affected by the
fortunes of the Christian Church, this shifting
and opposite face of things could not be exhibited
together; but was to be set forth in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
several and successive, though contemporary,
visions. Hence, the prophecy is thought to
proceed, when, in fact, it stands still, and
only presents another prospect of the same
transactions.</p>

<p>But I enter no farther into the mysterious
contexture of this book; through which, however,
the clue of the synchronisms, if well pursued,
would safely conduct us. It is enough
to my purpose to have shewn, That as the
<i>Language</i> of the Revelations is intelligible, so
the <i>Method</i> is not involved in such intricacies,
but that, in general, a regular, a consistent,
and, what is more, a <i>true</i><a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> conception may be
formed of it. Whence no sober man needs be
discouraged from reading this book; or will be
in danger, I think, of losing either his wits,
or his reputation, in the study of it. For what
should hinder a book, though of prophecies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
from being understood, when its <i>method</i> may
be clearly defined, and its <i>language decyphered</i>?
Provided always, that we only interpret
a prophecy by the event, and do not
take upon us to determine the event by a premature
construction of the prophecy.</p>

<p>With this Apocalyptic key then (of which
so much has been said), this <i>key of knowledge</i>,
in my hands, it may, now, be expected that
I should open this <i>dark parable</i> of the Revelation,
by applying so much of it, at least, as
respects Antichrist, to Apostate Papal Rome.
But, besides that there would not, in what remains
of this course, be room enough for a
detailed account of the prophecies, <i>other reasons</i>
restrain me from entering immediately on
a task, not less easy perhaps, than amusing.
For Interpreters, I think, have generally been
too much in haste to apply the prophecies, before
they had sufficiently prepared the way for
their application: So that, leaving many
doubts unresolved, which men of thought and
inquiry are apt to entertain on this subject,
or not laying before them all the reasons and
inducements, which should engage their attention
to it, their clearest expositions are not received,
and possibly not considered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>

<p>With regard, then, to the prophecies, concerning
Antichrist, though the chief obstructions
in our way seem fairly removed, and it
be now evident that there <i>are</i> certain grounds,
on which the most abstruse of them may be
reasonably interpreted, yet, because the application
of them is a work of time and industry,
many persons, before they undertake it, may
desire to know, What <small>GENERAL ARGUMENTS</small>
there are, which may assure them, beforehand,
that their labour will not be misemployed, and
that Papal Rome is, in fact, concerned in the
tenour of these prophecies: And, when this
demand has been made, they may further wish
to be informed, To what <small>ENDS OR USES</small> this
whole inquiry serves; of importance enough,
I mean, to encourage and reward their vigorous
prosecution of it?</p>

<p>These desires and expectations are apparently
not unreasonable: And to satisfy them,
in the best manner I can, will be the scope
and purpose of the two following Lectures.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

<h2 id="SERMON_XI">SERMON XI.<br />

<span class="large">PROPHETIC CHARACTERS OF
ANTICHRIST.</span><br />

<span class="medium"><span class="smcap">Luke</span> xii. 56.</span></h2>

<p class="table">&mdash;<i>How is it, that ye do not discern this time?</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">So</span> much having been said on the <i>manner</i>,
in which the prophecies, respecting Antichrist,
may be interpreted; I imagine that now, at
length, ye are disposed to ask, On what <small>GENERAL
GROUNDS</small> we affirm, that the Church of
Rome is actually concerned in them.</p>

<p>To resolve this question, it will be sufficient
to set before you, in few words, some of the
more obvious <i>notes</i>, or <i>characters</i>, by which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Antichrist is marked out in the prophecies:
such, and so many of them, as may convince
you, that they are fairly applicable to the
Church of Rome; and that, taken together,
they cannot well admit any other application.</p>

<p>Of these prophetic characters,</p>

<p>I. The <small>FIRST</small>, I shall mention, is, <i>That we
are to look for Antichrist within the proper
limits of the Roman empire</i>.</p>

<p>On this head, there is no controversy among
those who acknowledge the authority of the
prophet Daniel, and can be none: For that
prophet, in his famous vision of the four kingdoms,
says expressly, that, <i>among</i> the ten
kingdoms into which the fourth, or Roman,
shall be divided, <small>ANOTHER</small> <i>shall arise</i><a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>; that
is, as all interpreters agree, the kingdom of
Antichrist. So that this power, whatever it
be, must have its birth and seat within the
compass of the ten kingdoms, that is, of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Roman empire, when, in some future time
from the giving of Daniel’s prophecy, it should
be so divided.</p>

<p>But, to fix the station of the Antichristian
power more precisely, it is to be observed,
that, as the four kingdoms of Daniel, considered
in succession to each other, form a
<i>prophetic chronology</i><a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>; so in another view,
they form a <i>prophetic geography</i><a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>, being considered,
in the eye of prophecy, as <i>co-existent</i>,
as still <i>alive</i>, and subsisting together, when
the dominion of all, but the last, was taken
away<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>.</p>

<p>In consequence of this idea, which Daniel
gives us of his four kingdoms, so much only is
to be reckoned into the description of each
kingdom, as is peculiar to each; the remainder
being part of some other kingdom, still supposed
to be in being, to which it properly belongs.
Thus, the <small>SECOND</small>, or Persian kingdom,
does not take in the nations of Chald&aelig;a
and Assyria, which make the body of the <i>first</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
kingdom; nor the <small>THIRD</small>, or Gr&aelig;cian kingdom,
the countries of Media and Persia, being
the body of the <i>second</i>. In like manner, the
<small>FOURTH</small>, or Roman kingdom, does not, in the
contemplation of the prophet, comprehend
those provinces, which make the body of the
<i>third</i>, or Gr&aelig;cian kingdom, but such only as
constitute its own body, that is, the provinces
on this side of Greece: where, therefore, we
are to look for the <i>eleventh</i>, or Antichristian
kingdom, as being to start up <i>among</i> the ten,
into which the Roman kingdom should be divided.</p>

<p>We see, then, that, as Antichrist was to
arise within the Roman kingdom, so his station
is farther limited to the European part of
that kingdom, or to the <i>Western empire</i>, properly
so called.</p>

<p>This observation (which is not mine, but
Sir Isaac Newton’s) is the better worth making,
because, in fact, the papal sovereignty never
extended farther than the Western provinces;
at least, could never gain a firm and permanent
footing in the countries, which lie East of the
Mediterranean sea. But, whether you admit
this interpretation, or not, it is still clear that
Antichrist was to arise somewhere within the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
limits of the Roman empire. In what <i>part</i> of
that empire he was to make his appearance,
we certainly gather from</p>

<p>II. A <span class="smcap">Second</span> prophetical note or character
of this power, which is, <i>That his seat and
throne was to be the city of Rome itself</i>.</p>

<p>The prophet Daniel acquaints us only that
the power we call Antichristian, would spring
up from <i>among</i> the ruins of the fourth, or Roman
kingdom: But St. John, in the <i>Revelations</i>,
fixes his residence in the <i>capital city</i> of
that kingdom. For, when, in one of his visions,
he had been shewn a portentous <i>beast
with seven heads and ten horns, and a woman
arrayed in purple</i>, riding upon him, an Angel
is made to interpret this symbolic vision in the
following words&mdash;<i>The seven heads are seven
mountains on which the woman sitteth&mdash;and
the ten horns, which thou sawest, are ten
kings&mdash;and the woman, which thou sawest,
is that great city, which reigneth over the
kings of the earth</i><a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>.</p>

<p>Words cannot be more determinate, than
these. The <i>woman</i>, that rides this <small>BEAST</small>, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
is, the fourth empire, in its last state of <i>ten
horns</i>, or divided into ten kingdoms, is that
Antichristian power, of which we are now inquiring.
She is seated on <i>seven hills</i>, nay, she
is <i>that great city, which reigneth</i> [that is, in
St. John’s time which <i>reigned</i>] over the <i>kingdoms
of the earth</i>. Rome, then, is the throne
of Antichrist, or is that city, which shall one
day be Antichristian. There is no possibility
of evading the force of these terms.</p>

<p>It hath been said, that Constantinople, too,
was situated on seven hills. It may be so:
But Constantinople did not, in the time of this
vision, <i>reign over the kings of the earth</i>. Besides,
if its <i>dominion</i> had not been mentioned,
<i>the city on seven hills</i> is so characteristic of
Rome, that the name itself could not have
pointed it out more plainly: As must be evident
to all those, who recollect, what the Latin
writers have said on this subject.</p>

<p>The&mdash;<i>septem domini montes</i>&mdash;of one<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> poet
is well known; and seems the abridgement of
a still more famous line in another<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Septem urbs alta jugis, toto qu&aelig; pr&aelig;sidet orbi</i>:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span></p>

<p>To which, St. John’s idea of a <i>woman, seated
on seven hills, and reigning over the kings of
the earth</i>, so exactly corresponds, that one
sees no difference between the poet and the
prophet; except that the <i>latter</i> personifies his
idea, as the genius of the prophetic style required.</p>

<p>But a passage in Virgil is so much to our
purpose, that it merits a peculiar attention.
This poet, in the most finished of his works,
had been celebrating the praises of a country
life, which he makes the source and origin of
the Roman greatness.</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hanc</i> olim veteres vitam coluere Sabini;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hanc</i> Remus et frater: <i>sic</i> fortis Etruria crevit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scilicet et rerum facta est pulcherrima Roma<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The encomium, we see, is made with that
gradual pomp, which is familiar to Virgil.
And the last line (from its majestic simplicity,
the noblest, perhaps, in all his writings) one
would naturally expect should close the description.
Yet he adds, to the surprize, and,
I believe, to the disappointment of most
readers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Septemque una sibi muro circumdedit arces</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Had we found this passage in any other of
the Latin poets, we should have been apt to
question the judgment of the writer; and to
suspect, that, in attempting to rise upon himself,
he had fallen, unawares, into an evident
anti-climax. But the correct elegance of Virgil’s
manner, and his singular talent in working
up an image, by just degrees, to the precise
point of perfection, may satisfy us, that he
had his reason for going on, where we might
expect him to stop; which reason can be no
other, than that the <i>seven hills</i> were necessary
to complete his description of the imperial
city<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>. To an ancient Roman, the circumstance
of its <i>situation</i> was, of all others, the most
august and characteristic; and Rome itself was
not Rome, till it was contemplated under this
idea.</p>

<p>There was ground enough, then, for saying,
“that the <i>name</i> of Rome could not have
pointed out the city <i>more plainly</i>.” But I go
farther, and take upon me to assert, That the
<i>periphrasis</i> is even more precise, and less
equivocal, than the <i>proper name</i> would have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
been, if inserted in the prophecy. For <i>Rome</i>,
so called, might have stood, like Sodom, or
Babylon, simply for an idolatrous City. But
the city, <i>seated on seven hills</i>, and <i>reigning
over the earth</i>, is the city of Rome itself, and
excludes, by the peculiarity of these attributes,
any other application.</p>

<p>Nor is it any objection to the remark, now
made, that this city, whatever it be, is described
by <i>another</i> circumstance, not peculiar
to Rome, indeed scarce applicable to it, I
mean that of its being <i>seated on many waters</i><a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>.
For these <i>waters</i> are not given as a mark of
Rome’s <i>natural</i>, but <i>political</i> situation: as the
prophetic style might lead one to expect, if the
sacred writer had not taken care to prevent all
mistake by assuring us, in so many words,
That <i>the waters, where the whore sitteth, are</i>
<small>PEOPLES, AND MULTITUDES, AND NATIONS, AND
TONGUES</small><a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a>.</p>

<p>If it be, further, said, “That the <i>seven hills</i>
may, likewise, admit a similar construction
from the frequent use of <i>hills</i>, as emblems of
<i>power</i>, in hieroglyphic writing, and therefore
in prophetic description,” the remark is very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
just: but then, unluckily, there is no such
explanation of the <i>seven hills</i>, as we have of
the <i>waters</i>, from the prophet himself; while
yet it could not escape him, that such explanation
was more than commonly necessary
in this case, to prevent the reader from applying
the <i>seven hills</i> to the best-known city in
the world, then subsisting in all its glory, and
universally acknowledged by this distinctive
character of its situation.</p>

<p>Should it, lastly, be alledged, “That the
explanation is subjoined to the figure, for that
the prophet adds immediately in the following
verse&mdash;<i>and there are seven kings</i>&mdash;meaning,
that the <i>seven hills</i>, just mentioned, were to
be taken as emblems only of <i>seven kings</i>,” I
reply, that the <i>seven hills</i>, in the figurative
sense of the term, <i>hills</i>, naturally suggested,
and elegantly introduce, the <i>seven kings</i>; but
that the <i>former</i>, nevertheless, are clearly to be
distinguished from the <i>latter</i>. For it is not
said&mdash;<i>and the seven hills are seven kings</i>&mdash;as
it was before said&mdash;<i>the seven heads are seven
hills</i>&mdash;but&mdash;<small>AND</small> <i>there are seven kings</i>&mdash;plainly
advancing a step further in the prophecy,
and pointing out a new characteristic distinction
of the seven-hilled city, arising from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
the different forms of Government, through
which it had passed.</p>

<p>The truth is (as Mr. Mede well observes<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>)
<i>the seven heads of the beast</i>, are a <small>DOUBLE
TYPE</small>: <i>first</i>, they signify the <i>seven hills</i>, on
which the city is placed; and, <i>then</i>, the <i>seven
kings</i>, or governments, to which it had been
subject; but still <i>on</i> those seven hills, for
which reason the same type is made to signify
both: But, if the type had been designed to
carry a <i>single</i> sense, and <i>kings</i> had been that
sense, as explicatory of <i>hills</i>, it had been very
preposterous to give the <i>interpretation</i> of the
type, and then to <i>interpret</i> the interpretation,
unless the expression had been so guarded as to
convey this purpose in the most distinct manner.
As it is now put, there are manifestly
<small>TWO SENSES</small>, and <small>ONE TYPE</small><a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>On the whole, there can be no doubt concerning
<i>the great city on seven hills</i>. It can
be no other, than the city of Rome itself: In
other words, the Antichristian, is a <i>Roman
Power</i>.</p>

<p>Still, this Roman power, for any thing that
hath hitherto appeared, may be a <i>Pagan</i> and
<i>Civil</i> power. But</p>

<p>III. The prophecies seem very clearly to
point it out to us, <i>as an</i> <span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical</span> and,
in name and pretence, at least, <i>a</i> <span class="smcap">Christian</span>
<i>power</i>.</p>

<p>To begin again with the prophet, Daniel.
He tells us, that the Horn which shall <i>arise
after</i>, and from <i>among</i>, the ten horns, that is,
the Antichristian kingdom, as before explained,
shall be <small>DIVERSE</small> from the ten kingdoms, out
of which it shall arise<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>. “But a kingdom
may be <i>diverse</i> from other kingdoms, in various
respects.” Without doubt. And, therefore,
we cannot certainly conclude from this
single text, that the <i>diversity</i>, mentioned, will
consist in its being a spiritual kingdom. Yet,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
if ye reflect that this <i>diversity</i> is given, as the
characteristic mark of the Antichristian kingdom;
that, although there may be other and
smaller differences between kingdoms, the
greatest and most signal is that which subsists
between a temporal and spiritual power; nay,
that Government, as such, is, and can only
be, of two sorts, civil and spiritual, as corresponding
to the two constituent parts of <i>man</i>,
(the subject of all government in this world,)
the Soul and the Body: Taking, I say, these
considerations along with you, ye cannot
esteem it a very harsh and violent interpretation,
if, without looking any farther, we incline
to think that this <i>diversity</i> of regimen,
so emphatically pointed out, respects that great
and essential difference in human government,
<i>only</i>. At least, it will be admitted, that, if,
from other and more express testimonies, the
government of Antichrist appear to be a spiritual
government, we shall, then, be authorized
to put such a construction on Daniel’s prophecy,
as will reach the full force and import
of his expression. Such a kingdom must be
allowed to be eminently <i>diverse</i> from secular
kingdoms. So that the harmony between the
prophets on this subject will be clear and
striking.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>

<p>Now, such a testimony we seem to find in
the Apostle, St. Paul; who, prophesying of
<i>the man of Sin</i>, or Antichrist, to be revealed
in the latter days, makes it a distinguishing
part of his character, <i>That he</i> <span class="smcap">sitteth in the
temple of God</span><a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>. Consider the force of these
words. A power, <i>seated in the temple of God</i>,
can be nothing but a power suitable to that
place, or a <i>spiritual</i> power: just as a power,
<i>seated in the throne of C&aelig;sar</i>, could only be
interpreted of a <i>civil</i> power.</p>

<p>Nor say, because the context runs thus&mdash;“that
he, <span class="smcap">as God</span>, sitteth in the temple of
God, <small>SHEWING</small> himself that he <span class="smcap">is God</span>&mdash;that
therefore it only means his claiming <i>divine
honours</i>: a degree of blasphemy, very applicable
to a <i>civil</i> power.” This objection has
clearly no force: because his <i>sitting in the
temple of God</i> was the very <i>means</i> (if we
rightly apply this prophecy) by which the man
of sin rose to that abominable pre-eminence.
It was by virtue of his <i>spiritual</i>, that he assumed
a <i>divine</i> character. So that the phrase&mdash;<i>as
God</i>&mdash;and that other&mdash;<i>shewing himself
that he is God</i>&mdash;sets before us, indeed, the
extravagant height to which the man of sin
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
aspired, and to which he ascended; but, no
way invalidates the conclusion from his sitting
in the temple of God&mdash;that he was a <i>spiritual
power</i>. Rather, we see the propriety of this
conclusion: because the text, thus understood,
suggests the <i>way</i> in which the man of sin accomplished
his blasphemous purpose: His <i>success</i>
arose, from his <i>station</i> in the temple. On
the other hand, a power <i>sitting in the throne
of C&aelig;sar</i>, might sit there <i>as God</i>, and might
<i>shew himself that he was God</i> (as many of the
Roman Emperors did:) So that the clause&mdash;<i>sitting
in the temple of God</i>&mdash;has evidently
no peculiar fitness, as applied to the usurpation
of divine honours by a <i>civil tyrant</i>; whereas
we see it has that fitness, when applied to a
<i>spiritual</i> tyrant. The context therefore proves
nothing against the interpretation, here proposed
and defended.</p>

<p>But, what is this <i>temple of God</i>? The
temple at Jerusalem, it will be said; the only
temple, so called, then subsisting in the world<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Admit this to be the literal sense of the words.
Yet ye remember so much of what hath been
said concerning the prophetic style, as not to
think it strange, that the literal sense should
involve in it another, a <i>mystical</i> meaning.
And this, without any uncertainty whatsoever.
For so, the term, <i>Jew</i>, means a <i>Christian</i>;
the term, <i>David</i>, means <i>Christ</i>; the <i>incense</i>
of the temple-service, means the <i>prayers</i> of
Christians; plainly and confessedly so, in
numberless instances. Agreeably to this analogical
use of Jewish terms, in the style of the
prophets, <i>the temple of God</i>, nay <i>the temple
of Jerusalem</i><a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> (if that had been the expression)
must, in all reason, be interpreted of the
<i>Christian church</i>, and could not, in the prophetic
language, be interpreted otherwise.
When, therefore, Antichrist is said to <i>sit in
the temple of God</i>, it is the same thing as if it
had been said of him, <i>That he sitteth</i>, or
ruleth, <i>in the church of Christ</i>. Now, substitute
these words&mdash;<i>the church of Christ</i>&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
the room of those other words&mdash;<i>the temple
of God</i>; and see, if St. Paul, supposing his
purpose had been to express a spiritual power
in opposition to a civil; see, I say, if St.
Paul could have conveyed that purpose more
plainly.</p>

<p>Still, we have another, and, if possible, a
more decisive testimony in the <i>Revelations</i>.
For, among the different views, which St.
John gives us of Antichrist, in so many distinct
visions, one is set before us in the following
manner&mdash;<i>And I beheld another beast coming
up out of the earth, and he had two horns like
a lamb, and he spake as a Dragon</i><a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>. Now,
if we had known nothing more of these symbols,
than what the obvious qualities of the
animals themselves suggested to us, we could
only have inferred, that this ruling power (for
that is the idea conveyed by the term, <i>Beast</i>)
would put on the appearance of a gentle and
pacific administration: I say, the <i>appearance</i>;
for what its <i>real</i> character was to be, is clearly
enough expressed in what follows, that this
lamb-like beast <i>spake as a Dragon</i>. But,
when we further reflect, that <i>horns</i>, in the
prophetic style, are the emblems of <i>power</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
and that a <i>Lamb</i> is the peculiar, the <i>appropriated</i>
symbol of Christ, <i>the lamb of God, which
taketh away the sin of the world</i><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>, and is constantly
so employed throughout this whole prophecy
of the Revelations, we must, of necessity,
conclude that <i>a beast with the horns of a
lamb</i> can only be a state or person, pretending
to such powers, as Christ exercised, and his
Religion authoriseth; that is, powers, <i>not of
this world</i>, but purely spiritual.</p>

<p>The other symbol of a <i>Dragon</i>, confirms this
conclusion. For a <i>Dragon</i>, in the prophecies,
is the known symbol of the old Roman Government
in its pagan, persecuting state. When,
therefore, it is said that the beast <i>spake as a
Dragon</i>, the meaning is, That Antichrist
should assume the highest tone of civil authority
in promoting his tyrannous purposes,
though he cloked his fierce pretensions under
the meek semblance of a spiritual character.
Taken together, these two symbols speak as
plainly, as symbolic terms can speak, That
Antichrist was to be a <i>religious person</i>, acting
in the spirit of a <i>secular tyrant</i>. So exactly is
he characterised by the poet Mantuan, addressing
himself to one of the Popes&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ense</i> potens <i>gemino</i>, cujus vestigia adorant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C&aelig;sar et aurato vestiti murice reges.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the whole, I leave it to be considered,
whether, when the prophecies pronounce of
Antichrist, that he should be, a power <i>diverse</i>
from all others&mdash;that he should <i>sit in the temple
of God</i>&mdash;and that he should have <i>the horns
of a lamb</i>&mdash;I leave it, I say, to your consideration,
whether it be not plain that this extraordinary
power, a Roman power, and residing
at Rome, was to be a <i>Christian and Ecclesiastical</i>,
and not a <i>Pagan and Civil</i> power.</p>

<p>IV. Another obvious character of Antichrist,
or rather, <i>complication</i> of characters, is that
triple brand, impressed upon him, of a <i>tyrannical,
intolerant, and idolatrous</i>, power.</p>

<p>The prophets hold him up to us, as <i>reigning</i>,
or exercising an oppressive and supereminent
dominion, <i>over the kings of the earth</i>,
that is, of the Western empire<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>; as <i>making
war with the lamb, and the saints who receive
not his mark in their foreheads</i><a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>, that is, persecuting
good and conscientious Christians, who
refuse to wear the badge of Antichrist, and to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
serve under him; and, as another <i>Babylon, the
mother of harlots and abominations of the
earth</i><a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>, that is, as polluted himself with the
grossest idolatry, and as corrupting the nations
with the same prophane worship.</p>

<p>But these marks, it will be said, have been
found upon so many powers, which have appeared
in the world, that they cannot be given
as the <i>distinctive</i> marks of <i>one</i>, that is, of the
Papal Power: Nay, the Bishop of Meaux goes
further, and attempts to shew, by a very refined
argument, that the very <i>terms</i> of <i>whoredom</i>
and <i>fornication</i>, in which the <i>last</i> of these
marks, I mean, <small>IDOLATRY</small>, is set forth by the
prophet in the <i>book of Revelations</i>, make it
impossible for us to apply that mark to Rome
Christian.</p>

<p>Let us see, then, <i>first</i>, what force there is
in the criticism of this learned Prelate.</p>

<p>That <i>whoredom</i>, or <i>fornication</i>, in the language
of scripture, means <i>idolatry</i>, is agreed
on all hands, and cannot be disputed: Whether
the figurative use of this term arose from
observing, how constantly that pollution attended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
idolatrous worship; or how fitly a communication
with false gods may be compared
with that unlawful commerce: Whatever be
the ground of the analogy, it is clear to a demonstration
that <i>whoredom</i> is but another name
for <i>idolatry</i>, which, under this idea, is very
frequently charged upon the Jews by the ancient
prophets.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, (without doubt, to aggravate
the charge) the idolatry of the Jews is
considered in the light of <i>adultery</i>, that is, of
infidelity to the God of Israel; to whom, as to
her proper Lord and <i>Husband</i>, the Jewish nation
had, by express stipulation, and in the
most solemn manner, contracted herself.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this promiscuous application
of the terms, <i>fornication</i>, and <i>adultery</i>,
to the idolatry of the Jews in the ancient
prophecies, it hath been remarked by the Bishop
of Meaux, “That Babylon, or Rome, in
the Revelations, is constantly and uniformly
spoken of, as a <i>whore</i>, and not as an <i>adulteress</i>:
whence he concludes, that this charge
is brought against Pagan Rome only, and not
Christian Rome. For, why, he asks, is so
much care taken not to impute <i>adultery</i> to
idolatrous Rome, if it had been a Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
city? when its polluting itself with this crime,
contrary to the most express engagements,
which Christians take upon themselves, of
fidelity to the only true God, might justly deserve,
and, in propriety, may seem to require,
this opprobrious charge, rather than that other
lighter one of <i>fornication</i>; whereas, if Pagan
Rome be here meant, its idolatry could only
be set forth under the idea of <i>fornication</i>, and
not of <i>adultery</i><a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>Now, although, as I observed, the idolatrous
Jews are frequently treated by their prophets,
as <i>fornicators</i>, as well as <i>adulterers</i>,
nay, are much more frequently<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> represented
under the <i>former</i> idea, than the <i>latter</i>; and
although it be therefore true, that <i>fornication</i>
is not necessarily, and exclusively, to be understood
of Pagan idolatry, but may well be
applied to Christian idolaters, as it was to the
Jewish; yet the force of the learned objector’s
argument will not be obviated by this observation
only. For the stress of it lies in this,
“That the idolatry of Rome in the Revelations
is <i>every where</i>, that is, purposely, termed <i>fornication</i>
(to insinuate to us, that the charge is
directed against a Pagan City, and not a Christian
Church), and <i>no where</i>, that is, purposely
again, called <i>adultery</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span></p>

<p>The objection is extremely ingenious; and,
so far as I know, hath been, hitherto, unanswered.
Yet, if any good reason can be assigned
why the prophet should thus studiously
prefer the term, <i>fornication</i>, to that of <i>adultery</i>,
in describing the idolatry of Christian
Rome, notwithstanding those terms be used
indifferently by the Jewish prophets, when they
reprove the idolatry of their own countrymen,
the Bishop of Meaux would himself acknowledge,
that his objection falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Now such a reason offers itself to us in the
<small>EMBLEM</small>, under which St. John chuses to represent
his idolatrous society. This emblem
is, <i>Babylon</i>; a Pagan idolatrous city; to which
the idea of <i>fornication</i> may be colourably, and
hath, in fact, been, applied<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>, in order to express
the transgression of the law of nature, in
its idolatrous worship: But to such a city,
<i>adultery</i>, could in no proper sense, be applied;
because, it had never entered into any close
engagement, or <i>marriage-contract</i>, as it were,
with the God of heaven.</p>

<p>This being admitted, we see the reason,
why Rome Christian is taxed as a <i>whore</i> simply,
and not as an adulteress. For what had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
been improperly said of the <i>type</i>, cannot, on
the principles of decorum, be transferred to the
<i>anti-type</i>. If Babylon be only a <i>harlot</i>, she is
a harlot still, and nothing more, when she
stands for Rome, whether Pagan, or Christian.
The concinnity of the figure, and the just correspondence
of the thing signified to the sign,
demands the observance of this rule; which
cannot be violated without manifest absurdity
and confusion.</p>

<p>“But why then, it is asked, was such an
emblem employed? Why was not Jerusalem,
or Samaria (of which <i>adultery</i> might be predicated)
rather chosen, than Babylon, for the
type, or representation of <i>idolatrous Christian
Rome</i>?”</p>

<p>The reason, again, is obvious. It was, because
Babylon was the <i>first</i> of all idolatrous
cities; and the <i>fittest</i><a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> to emblematize the
enormous guilt, or to set in full light the extensive
influence, of idolatrous Rome. For
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
each, in its turn, was <i>the mother of harlots
and abominations of the earth</i>; the <i>former</i>
corrupting the <i>heathen</i> world with her fornication,
and the latter, the <i>Christian</i>.</p>

<p>When therefore for this, or the like reason,
Babylon was made the emblem of Christian
Rome, the prophet was obliged to retain the
idea of fornication, only, and not to interpose
that of adultery, through the whole tenour of
his application.</p>

<p>It may, further, be worth observing, that
<i>pagan</i> idolatry is, for the most part, exposed
by the ancient prophets under the notion of
<small>LYES</small>, or <small>LYING VANITIES</small><a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>; and very rarely, I
think in no more than one or two short passages,
under that of <i>fornication</i>. For vague
lust was so generally practised in the heathen
world, and the law of nature, condemning that
vice, so little known, or respected by it, that
the metaphor would not have conveyed to a
Pagan idolater the atrocious nature of his
crime. The Mosaic Law, on the other hand,
interdicting fornication in the severest terms,
and requiring that <i>there should be no whore of
the daughters of Israel</i><a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>, the guilt of idolatry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
was very forcibly, as well as naturally, represented
to a Jew, under that idea.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we find, that the prophets
every where, and in whole pages, employ this
figure, when they address themselves to Jewish
idolaters. Whence it may seem, that, although
there be sufficient authorities to justify the
prophet St. John in considering his emblematic
Babylon under the idea of a <i>harlot</i>, yet he
would not have prosecuted even this inferior
charge of <i>fornication</i> so far as he has done,
and in so many parts of his prophecy, if his
purpose had not been to apply it to a <i>believing</i>,
and not a Pagan city. If the mystical Babylon
be <i>Christian</i> Rome, we see the force and
propriety of this representation; which had
clearly been less apt, if Pagan Rome, according
to the Bishop of Meaux, had been intended
by the prophet.</p>

<p>We see then, in both ways, why Rome is
not an <i>adulteress</i> in the Revelations; and why
she is so emphatically, a <i>harlot</i>. The type
employed forbad the <i>former</i> charge, though
the anti-type be <i>Rome Christian</i>: The <i>latter</i>
charge had not been so much laboured, if the
anti-type had been <i>Rome Pagan</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<p>Thus, the edge of this acute objection is entirely
taken off, and the execution, it was to
make on the Protestant system, prevented.</p>

<p>To return, now, to the consideration of our
<i>three</i> marks. These marks, it is said, agree
to so many other powers, besides that of the
Papacy, that they cannot be made the peculiar,
distinctive characters of Christian Rome.
And, without doubt, considered merely in
themselves, they cannot. But, having already
understood that the power, thus stigmatized,
is a power seated in the <i>seven-hilled</i> city, and
that too, an <i>ecclesiastical</i> power, one sees
clearly that, if the prophecies have hitherto received
their accomplishment in any degree,
these marks can only be sought in Papal Rome,
and must be the proper, exclusive characters
of that power. I say, <i>one sees this</i>; but, it
must be owned, not without amazement,
That a species of government, calling itself
Christian, and professing to model itself on
the example of the <i>Lamb</i>, on the pure and
simple principles of the Gospel, should yet be
all over stained with those specific vices, which
Christianity most abhors&mdash;the utmost pride
of secular domination&mdash;the most relentless
zeal against the rights of conscience&mdash;and,
what is still more incredible, the most blasphemous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
idolatry. The accumulated infamy of
these crimes struck the prophet, St. John, so
forcibly, that, on the sight of this portentous
monster, exhibited to him in the vision, <i>he
wondered</i>, as himself expresses it, <i>with great
admiration</i><a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>.</p>

<p>But, strange as this vision appeared to the
sacred <i>prophet</i>, the Papal history is found to
realize all the wonders of it: And, backward
as we may be to interpret this vision of a
church, professedly Christian, that church herself
is so little scandalized at the imputation of
these crimes, that she is ready to avow them
all; the <i>two first</i>, directly and openly; and
the <i>last</i>, when set in a certain light, and explained
in her own manner. In short, she
prides herself in the <i>extent of her sway</i><a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
the <i>fire of her zeal</i><a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>, and only quibbles with
us about the meaning of the term, <i>idolatry</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<p>To cut the matter short, then, and to keep
clear of those endless debates concerning the
worship of <i>Images</i>, of the <i>Cross</i>, and of the
<i>Host</i> in the celebration of the Mass; debates,
which a dextrous sophist may find means to
carry on with a shew of argument, and with
some degree of plausibility; To set aside, I say,
all these topics, let it be observed, at once,
That <i>idolatry</i>, in the scriptural sense of the
word, is of <i>two sorts</i>, and consists either, 1. in
giving the honour due to the one true God, as
maker and governor of the world, to any other
supposed, though subordinate god; Or, 2, in
giving the honour due to Christ, as the sole
mediator between God and Man, to any other
supposed, though subordinate, mediator. The
<i>former</i>, is the idolatry forbidden by the Jewish
law, and by the law of Nature: The <i>latter</i>, is
Christian idolatry, properly so called, and is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
the abomination, prohibited and condemned,
in so severe terms, by the law of the Gospel.</p>

<p>Now, whether the <i>former</i> species of idolatry
be chargeable on the church of Rome or not;
and whether the <i>crime</i> of that species, may
not be incurred by honouring the true object
of worship, through the medium of some sensible
image: Whatever, I say, be determined
on these two points (which, for the present,
shall be set aside) the <i>other</i> species of idolatry
is, without all doubt, chargeable on any
Christian church that shall adopt or acknowledge,
in its religious addresses, another mediator,
besides Christ Jesus.</p>

<p>But the church of Rome (I do not say, in
the private writings of her divines, but) in the
solemn forms of her ritual, <i>publicly professes</i>,
and, by her canons and councils, <i>authoritatively
enjoyns</i>, the worship of saints and
angels, under the idea of mediators and intercessors:
not indeed in exclusion of Christ, as
<i>one</i>, or, if you will, as <i>chief</i> mediator, but in
manifest defiance of his claim to be, the <i>sole</i>
mediator. This charge is truly and justly
brought against that Church, as it now stands,
and hath stood, for many ages; and cannot,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
by any subterfuge whatsoever, be evaded<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>.
And therefore, to the other characters of <i>Pride</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
and <i>Intolerance</i>, which she takes to herself
with much complacency, she must, now, be
content (whether she will or no) to have that
of <span class="smcap">D&AElig;MON-WORSHIP</span>, or <small>ANTICHRISTIAN IDOLATRY</small>,
fastened upon her.</p>

<p>Nor let the followers of that communion
think to elude this charge, by saying, <i>That
they only request the saints, as we commonly
do any good man, to pray for them</i><a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>. False
and disingenuous! <i>False</i>; because their breviaries
and litanies shew, that they supplicate the
saints to befriend them by their own inherent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
power, or to intercede for them to the throne of
God by virtue of their own personal merits<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>, in
blasphemous derogation to the all-atoning and
incommunicable intercession of Jesus. <i>Disingenuous</i>,
too; because they know very well, that
the question is concerning unseen and heavenly
mediators only, not men like ourselves, such
as we live and converse with on earth; whom
we only admonish of their duty, and to whom
we only do ours, when we call upon them to
exert an act of piety and common charity in
praying for their fellow-christians. Our meaning
is but that which the Apostle well expresses,
when he would have us <i>consider one another,
to provoke unto love and to good works</i><a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>;
and not at all to supplicate our Christian brethren
as powerful intercessors, in whose meritorious
virtues we confide, and to whom, as
possessing a proper interest in the Almighty,
by the worth of their own persons, we commit
our dearest concerns, The forgiveness of our
sins, and the salvation of our souls.</p>

<p>“But this, it will be said, is a very defective,
and even unfair, account of the matter.
We do more than admonish our brethren of
their duty, when we sollicit their prayers for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
us. We invite them directly, and formally,
to <i>intercede</i> for us to the throne of Grace. We
are allowed, nay encouraged, to lay a stress on
their intercession; and, what is more, we are
given to understand that such intercession,
especially if it be made by good men, will
have weight and influence in Heaven. What
else is the meaning of the Apostle, when he
assures us, <i>That the effectual fervent prayer
of a righteous man availeth much</i>. James v.
16.? And, if the prayer of <i>a righteous man</i>,
much more the prayer of glorified saints and
angels.”</p>

<p>I have put the argument, I think, in all its
force, and (because the advocates of the papal
cause affect to think it unanswerable) shall examine
it, with care.</p>

<p>“We apply to good Christians, or to those
we esteem such, to intercede for us by their
prayers to Heaven.” We do so; and are encouraged
in this application, by the <i>example</i>,
and by the <i>directions</i> of the Apostles. For I
shall not take advantage of what some have
conceived to be the meaning of St. James, in
the place alledged, where he attributes so much
to the prayer of, a righteous man, That the
prayer, there spoken of, is <i>the prayer of faith</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
or a spiritual gift miraculously conferred on
the first teachers of the Gospel, and confined
to their ministry: I will not, I say, take advantage
of this gloss; because, whatever foundation
it may seem to have in the context of
that epistle, I allow it to be clear from other
places of the New Testament<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>, That the duty
of Christians is to pray, that is, to <i>intercede</i>,
for each other.</p>

<p>But then I desire it may be observed,</p>

<p>1. What difference there is between desiring
good men to pray for us, in the Gospel sense
of that duty; and desiring Saints and Angels
to pray for us, in the sense of the papal rituals.
We request those prayers, only as they shall
be offered up in the name, and through the
merits, of the great, and properly speaking,
sole intercessor; and we look for no effect
from them, but on that condition. The Church
of Rome addresses herself to Saints and
Angels, as <i>intercessors</i>, by, what we may
call, their own right, by virtue of their own
inherent sanctity: Or, rather, she applies to
them directly, as to <i>Saviours</i>, for their proper
and immediate help, and expects it from
the supposed privilege of their rank, or merits,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
independently of their <i>prayers</i>, or, at least, of
the <i>manner</i> in which those prayers shall be
presented through the name of Jesus. The
formal words of their Litanies shew, that such
is their meaning.</p>

<p>But they will say, that this condition of interceding,
or saving, through the merits of
Christ, is implied, though not expressed. I
reply then,</p>

<p>2. That, admitting it to be so, there is, yet,
the widest difference between <i>praying</i> to Saints
and Angels to pray for us, though in the
Gospel forms of intercession; and merely <i>requesting</i>
good men to pray for us, in those
forms. The <i>latter</i> address is made in a way
remote from all appearance of idolatry, and
free from the suspicion of it: The <i>former</i>, is
preferred in the <i>place</i>, at the <i>time</i>, with the
<i>posture</i>, in the <i>language</i>, in short, with all
the circumstances and formalities of divine
worship.</p>

<p>3. I observe, that, when we ask the prayers
of men, we know that they hear our address to
them: We cannot even suppose thus much of
Saints and Angels, without ascribing to them
the incommunicable attributes of the Almighty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>Still, it may be insisted, That prayers, whether
offered up to God by men, or glorified
spirits, are however to be considered in the
light of <i>Intercessions</i>; and that therefore, so
far as we combat the practice of saint-worship
on that ground, Protestants, as well as Papists,
when they employ the prayers of others, are
guilty of idolatry.</p>

<p>This, in truth, is the hinge, on which the
question turns: And, to shew the difference
of the two cases, palpably and clearly, I say,</p>

<p>Fourthly, and lastly, That the Gospel, in
permitting, or rather in commanding us to ask
the prayers of each other, justifies this sort of
intercession, and absolves it from the blame
and guilt of idolatry. It gives a sanction to
this mode of mediating with God by his Saints,
on earth; and does not regard it as a practice
that interferes with the mediatorial office of
Jesus, in Heaven.</p>

<p>The same Gospel, on the contrary, (I inquire
not, for what reasons) says not a word,
from which we can infer, that any such address
is directed, or permitted, to be made to Angels
or Spirits. It even condemns all addresses of
this kind, under the opprobrious name of unauthorized,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
or <span class="smcap">Will-worship</span><a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>. Though we
be allowed, then, to have good men, in some
sense, for our mediators or intercessors on
earth, we are not allowed to have any mediator
or intercessor in the tabernacle of heaven, but
Jesus, the great high priest of Christians, only.
This last sort of intercession, by Angels and
glorified Saints, is against the spirit and letter
of our religion. It is a practice, which, not
being enjoined, is forbidden; which, being
disallowed, is reprobated. In a word, It entrenches
on the incommunicable honour and
prerogatives of the great, the appointed, the
sole Mediator in Heaven, seated at God’s right
hand, <i>who ever liveth to make intercession for
us</i><a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>. It sets up new mediators, without, and
against his leave: It is, then, un-christian,
and <i>idolatrous</i>.</p>

<p>Thus at length, I suppose, it appears indisputably,
That we are neither unreasonable,
nor uncharitable, in charging <small>IDOLATRY</small>, as
well as the other two anti-christian vices of
<i>pride</i>, and <i>intolerance</i>, to the account of
papal Rome.</p>

<p>V. The last prophetic mark of Antichrist,
which I shall have time to point out to you,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
and what perhaps you may esteem the most
material of all, is, <i>The</i> <small>TIME</small> <i>in which that
power is said to make its appearance in the
world</i>.</p>

<p>It hath been already observed<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>, that the
<i>chronology</i> of the prophecies is, for the most
part, not defined with that exactness, which
we expect in historical compositions. It is
commonly expressed in terms that may be interpreted
with some latitude; or, when the
date is more precisely delivered, we are still at
a loss, in some respect or other, before the
event, in what manner to form our calculation.
However, the expression is not so loose and
vague, but that we may clearly apprehend
<i>about</i> what time the predicted event will come
to pass.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, the season of Christ’s
<i>coming into the world</i> was fixed by such circumstances
as these&mdash;that it should be before
the total dissolution of the Jewish state&mdash;or
while the second temple was yet standing:
And, when it was determinately foretold to be
after the expiration of <i>seventy weeks, from the
going forth of the commandment to return</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
<i>and to build Jerusalem</i>, still, besides the prophetic
and somewhat obscure sense of the
word <i>weeks</i>, we cannot beforehand calculate
exactly <i>when</i> these weeks commence<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>, or in
what term they are to be accomplished. Yet,
notwithstanding these uncertainties, the Jews
saw very clearly, and, from them, the rest of
the world conceived an expectation, that the
person predicted was to appear in that age, or
<i>about</i> that time, in which he did appear, and
which, from the tenour of the prophecies, they
had computed would be the time of his appearance.</p>

<p>In like manner, the season of Antichrist’s
appearance in the world is left to be collected
from general intimations; and, when the duration
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
of his tyranny is limited to <i>twelve hundred
and sixty days</i>, besides that the expression,
as before, is &aelig;nigmatical, we have no
means of fixing the commencement of that period
so precisely, but that some doubts may
arise about it, till the accomplishment of the
prophecy shall give light and certainty to the
computation. Yet still, as in the former case,
we have such <i>data</i> to proceed upon in calculating
the reign of Antichrist, as may let us
see <i>about</i> what time it was to be expected.</p>

<p>Thus much being premised, I have now
only to remind you of what the prophets expressly
declare concerning the rise of Antichrist.
The eldest of these, the prophet
Daniel, says it was to be in the time of the
<i>fourth</i> kingdom, that is, of the Roman; which,
for the convenience of the prophetic calculations,
is considered as subsisting, though in a
new form, under the ten kings, among whom
it was to be divided. He further tells us, that
Antichrist was to arise from <i>among</i>, and <i>after</i>,
the ten kings; that is, we are to look for him
<i>then</i>, (and not before) when the Roman empire
has undergone that change of government<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span></p>

<p>Next, St. Paul, it seems, had told the Thessalonians,
what it was that, for a time, prevented
the appearance of Antichrist: But that
information hath not been transmitted to us.
However, he says to them&mdash;<i>Ye know</i> <small>WHAT</small>
<i>with-holdeth that he might be revealed in his
time</i>: and further adds, <small>HE</small>, <i>who now letteth,
will let, until he be taken out of the way</i><a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>.</p>

<p>Now, by putting these passages together,
and by comparing them with the predictions
of Daniel, not we of these later times only,
before whom <i>the man of sin</i> is supposed to be
evidently displayed, but the early fathers of the
church, long before the events happened to
which these prophetic notices could be applied,
clearly saw, or at least generally conjectured,
that the impediment, here mentioned, was the
then subsisting power of the C&aelig;sarean government;
which, they said, was first to be taken
away, and then Antichrist would be revealed<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Apostle St. John not only confirms
the prophecies of Daniel, that Antichrist
should arise out of the ten kings, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
were to have the western empire shared out
among them, but adds this remarkable circumstance,
That he should <small>RIDE</small> the ten kings<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>;
which implies, that he should <i>co-exist</i> with
them: And it further appears, that he was to
receive his whole power from them, and was
finally to be destroyed by them.</p>

<p>Now, turn to the history of the <i>fourth</i> kingdom,
and see how it corresponds to these prophecies.
Observe, when the western empire
under its C&aelig;sarean head, was taken away;
how it was, afterwards, dismembered by the
northern nations; by what degrees it fell at
length, into <i>ten</i>, that is, <i>many</i> distinct, independent
kingdoms; at what time this partition
was made, or rather fully settled and completed.
From this time, and not before, you
are to look for Antichrist, now gradually rearing
himself up among the ten kings; and at
length, in a condition, by the power, which
they gave to him, to <i>ride</i>, that is, to direct
and govern them. From this time, again,
compute the 1260 years, the predicted period
of his government; and, keeping your eye all
along on the ecclesiastical and civil state of our
western world (the predicted theatre of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
these transactions) see, if you can help concluding,
I do not say at what precise time,
but <i>about</i> what time, Antichrist appeared; see,
if the <i>commencement</i> of his reign be not so far
determined as that you may be certain of its
being long since past; and see, if very much,
at least, of that allotted <i>period</i>, through which
his dominion was to continue, according to
the prophecies, be not, by the evident attestation
of history, now run out.</p>

<p>To <small>DRAW</small>, then, what hath been said on the
several marks of Antichrist, to a point. Consider,
within <i>what part</i> of the world, he was
to appear; in <i>what seat</i> or throne, he was to
be established; of <i>what kind</i>, his sovereignty
was to be; with <i>what attributes</i>, he was to be
invested; in <i>what season</i>, or <i>about what time</i>,
and for <i>how long a time</i>, he was to reign and
prosper: Consider these <small>FIVE</small> obvious characters
of Antichrist, which the prophets have
distinctly set forth, and which, from them, I
have successively held up to you: And, then,
compare them with the correspondent characters,
which you find inscribed, by the pen of
authentic history, on a certain power, sprung
up in the West; seated in the city of Rome;
calling himself the Vicar of Christ; yet <i>full of
names of blasphemy</i>, that is, stigmatized with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
those crimes, which Christianity, as such,
holds most opprobrious, the crimes of tyrannic
dominion, of persecution, and even Idolatry;
and lastly, now subsisting in the world, though
with evident symptoms of decay, after a long
reign, whose rise and progress can be traced,
and whose duration, hitherto, is uncontradicted
by any prophecy: Put, I say, all these correspondent
marks together, and see if they do
not furnish, if not an absolute demonstration,
yet a high degree of probability, that apostate
papal Rome is the very Antichrist foretold.</p>

<p>At least, you will admit that these correspondencies
are signal enough to merit your attention,
and even to justify your pains in looking
further into so curious and interesting a subject.
Ye will say to yourselves, That the prophecies
concerning Antichrist deserve at least to be
considered with care, since in so many striking
particulars, they appear, on the face of them,
to have been completed.</p>

<p>This <i>conclusion</i>, it is presumed, is a reasonable
one: And the end of this discourse will
be answered, if ye are, at length, prevailed
upon to <i>draw</i> this conclusion.

<p class="hang"><i>Behold, I come quickly: Blessed is he that
keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this
book.</i></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Before</span> we engage in a work of time and
difficulty, we naturally ask, “<span class="smcap">Cui Bono</span>, to
what considerable end and purpose, are our
labours to be referred?”</p>

<p>Although it may, then, be presumed, that
enough hath been said on the prophecies to
excite a reasonable desire of looking further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
into them, and even to produce a general persuasion,
that they have been, or may be, understood;
yet, it may quicken your attention
to this argument, and support your industry in
the prosecution of it, to set before you the
USES, which may result from a full and final
conviction (if such should be the issue of your
inquiries), That these prophecies are not intelligible
only, but have, in many instances,
been rightly applied, and clearly fulfilled.</p>

<p>These <small>USES</small> are very many. I shall collect,
only, <i>two or three</i> of the more important, for
your consideration.</p>

<p>Though every period of prophecy be instructive,
that which takes in the great events and
revolutions, which have come to pass in the
<i>Christian Church</i>, is, for obvious reasons,
more especially interesting to us, who live in
these latter ages of the world.</p>

<p>Of the numerous predictions, contained in
either Testament, which, it is presumed, respect
these events, the most considerable by
far, because the most minute and circumstantial,
are those of St. John in the <i>Revelations</i>;
which treat professedly of such things as were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
to befall <i>the servants of Jesus</i><a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>, from the prophet’s
own days, down to that awful period,
when all the mysterious councils of God, in
regard to the Christian dispensation, shall be
finally shut up in the day of judgment. To
these predictions, then, a more particular attention
is due, the rather because they have
been fulfilling from the time of their delivery&mdash;<i>behold,
I come quickly</i>&mdash;and, above all,
because a <i>blessing</i> is pronounced on those, who
keep, that is, who observe, who study and
contemplate, <i>the sayings of this book</i>.</p>

<p>Assuredly, then, this study will be rewarded
with signal benefits. And one sees immediately:</p>

<p>I. In the first place, that no small benefit
must arise to those, who admit the completion
of these prophecies, so far, I mean, as the
tenour of the book makes it probable that they
have been completed, <i>from the awful sense,
which this conviction must needs give them of
the Christian dispensation itself</i>.</p>

<p>That this dispensation, ushered in by so
long a train of prophecies, should still be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
attended by others, through all the stages and
periods of it; that secular empires should rise
and fall, unnoticed, as it were, by the Spirit
of God, while the kingdom of his Son is so
peculiarly distinguished, and its whole history,
in a manner, anticipated, by the most express
predictions: that Jesus should be, as he says
of himself, <i>the alpha and omega, the beginning
and the end</i><a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>, of all God’s religious dispensations
to mankind: that his <i>first coming</i>,
or personal appearance in the flesh, should be
signified from the foundation of the world, and
from time to time more explicitly declared in
a variety of successive prophecies, till the great
event, at length, fulfilled them all: and that,
together with this event (the foundation of
others, still more illustrious) his <i>second coming</i>,
in the future and gradual manifestations of his
power (for they were to be <i>gradual</i>) should be
distinctly marked out, and duly accomplished,
in the fortunes of the Christian church, or of
that kingdom, which he came to erect in the
world; while this subject, and no other, engaged
the ultimate attention of all the prophets:
There is, I say, in this scheme of things,
something so astonishingly vast, something so
much above and beyond the attention that was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
ever known to be paid to any other person or
thing in the compass of universal history, as
must strike an awe into the hearts of all men,
who consider Christianity in this point of view;
and must compel the most negligent to confess,
or suspect at least, That <i>such</i> a dispensation is
a matter of no light moment, but, indeed, the
most important in the eyes of Providence, and
the most interesting to mankind, that can be
conceived, or expressed.</p>

<p>If, then, there be reason, to <i>admit</i> the completion
of such prophecies, respecting such a
subject, in any considerable number of instances,
within that space of time which is already
elapsed; and, therefore, to <i>expect</i> that
the remaining prophecies will, in like manner,
be fulfilled, The conclusion is, that the dispensation
of God through Christ is of the last
consequence to the inhabitants of this world:
And the obvious <i>use</i> of this conclusion will be,
that it further obliges all serious men who have
thus far profited by a study of the sacred oracles,
to put that salutary question to themselves&mdash;<i>How
shall we escape, if we neglect so great
salvation<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>?</i></p>

<p>Connected with <i>this</i> use of prophecy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span></p>

<p>II. A <i>second</i> is, That it sets before us, not
the importance only, but the <i>truth</i> of Christianity,
in the strongest light.</p>

<p>So many illustrious events falling in, one
after another, just as the word of prophecy
foretold they should, must afford the most convincing
proof, That our Religion is, as it
claims to be, of divine institution: a <i>proof</i>,
the more convincing, because it is continually
growing upon us; and, the farther we are removed
from the source of our religion, the
clearer is the evidence of its truth. Other
proofs are supposed to be, and, in some degree,
perhaps, are, weakened by a length of time.
But this, from prophecy, as if to make amends
for their defects, hath the peculiar privilege of
strengthening by age itself: till hereafter, as
we presume, the accumulated force of so much
evidence shall overpower all the scruples of infidelity;
and bring about, at length, that general
conversion both of Jew and Gentile,
which the sacred oracles have so expressly foretold.</p>

<p>In both these ways, then, by impressing on
the mind the most affecting sense of Christianity;
that is, by giving us, <i>first</i>, the most
<i>awful view of its pretensions</i>, and <i>then</i>, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
producing the <i>firmest conviction of its truth</i>,
the word of prophecy hath an evident tendency,
in proportion as we see its accomplishment,
to promote the great ends, for which it
was given, till <i>the earth shall be filled with
the knowledge of the Lord</i>, and <i>all the inhabitants
of the world shall learn righteousness</i><a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>.</p>

<p>These uses are general, and concern <i>all</i>
men: The</p>

<p>III. <i>Next</i>, I shall mention, is more especially
addressed to <i>thinking</i> and inquisitive
men.</p>

<p>When the view of things, exhibited under
the two preceding articles, has raised our admiration,
to the utmost, of the divine councils
in contriving, preparing, and at length executing
so vast a scheme, as that of Christianity,
for the benefit of mankind; we are led to expect
that the <i>effect</i> will correspond to the
<i>means</i> employed, and that a striking change
will, at length, be brought about in the condition
of the moral world.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span></p>

<p>But, in surveying the history of this new
religion, the theme of so many prophecies,
and the great, the favourite object, if I may
so speak, of divine Providence, “some are not
a little scandalized to observe that nothing hath
come to pass in any degree equivalent to such
an expence of forethought and contrivance;
that, for a season, indeed, virtue and piety
seemed to triumph, in the exemplary lives of
the first converts to this religion, and in the
overthrow of Pagan idolatry; but that this
golden age was soon over; and that, now, for
more than fourteen hundred years, the passions
of men have kept their usual train, or rather
have expatiated with more licence and fury in
the Christian world, than in the Pagan; that
<i>idolatry</i>, in all its forms, has revived in the
bosom of Christianity; and, as to <i>private
morals</i>, that this Religion has even made men
worse than it found them, or, at best, of corrupt
sensualists, has only made them intolerant
and vindictive bigots; that, in a word, the
<i>kingdom of heaven</i>, as it is called, has, hitherto,
neither served to the glory of God, nor
to the good of mankind; at least, to neither
of these ends, in the <i>degree</i>, that might
have been expected from such high pretensions.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<p>The colouring of this picture, we will say,
is too strong: but the outline, at least, is
fairly given. The corruptions of the Christian
world have been notorious and great; and
though they are indeed the corruptions of men
calling themselves Christians, and not the
vices of Christianity, yet he who the most dispassionately
contemplates so sad a scene, can
hardly reconcile appearances to what must have
been his natural expectations.</p>

<p>Here, then, the prophecies of this book, I
mean, of the Apocalypse, come in to our relief.
This book contains a detailed account of
what would befall mankind under this last and
so much magnified dispensation. It foretells
all that history has recorded. It sets before us
the corrupt state of the Christian world in almost
as strong a light, as that in which our
indignant speculatist himself has placed it.
But it, likewise, opens better things to our
view. It shews, that the <i>end</i> of this dispensation
is to promote virtue and happiness; and
that this end shall finally, but through many
and long obstructions, be accomplished. It
represents the cause of righteousness, as still
maintaining itself in all the conflict, to which
it is exposed; as gradually gaining ground, and
prevailing, through the secret aid of divine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Providence, over all opposition, till it obtains
a firm and permanent establishment; till <i>the
Saints reign</i> (not in a fanatical, but in the
sober and evangelical sense of that word, <i>reign</i>)
<i>in the earth</i><a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>; till <i>the Lord God omnipotent
reigneth</i><a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>.</p>

<p>So far, then, as these prophecies appear to
have been completed, they reconcile us to that
disordered scene, which hath hitherto been
presented to us; and give repose to the anxious
mind, in the assured hope of better things to
come. The worst, that has <i>happened</i>, was
foreseen; and the best, that we <i>conceive</i>, will
hereafter come to pass. Thus, the reasonable
expectations of men are answered, and the
honour of God’s government abundantly vindicated.</p>

<p>IV. The <i>last</i> use, I shall suggest to you, is
that which immediately results from the study
of the Apocalyptic prophecies <i>concerning Antichrist</i>;
I mean, <i>the support that is hereby
given to Protestantism against all the cavils
and pretensions of its adversaries</i>.</p>

<p>For, if these prophecies are rightly applied
to Papal Rome, and have, in part, been signally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
accomplished in the history of that
church, it is beyond all doubt, that our communion
with it is dangerous; nay, that our
separation from it is a matter of strict duty.
<i>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not
partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not
of her plagues</i><a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>&mdash;are plain and decisive
words, and, if allowed to be spoken of that
church, bring the controversy between the
Protestant and Papal Christians to a short
issue.</p>

<p>I know, the advocates of Rome pretend, that,
not a sense of duty, but a <i>spirit of revenge</i>
operates in the minds of Protestants, when
they affect to lay so great a stress on the Apocalyptic
prophecies. “<i>Reward her, even as
she rewarded you</i><a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>”&mdash;is, they say, another of
their favourite texts, by which they take themselves
to be as much obliged, as by that which
they so commonly alledge for quitting her
communion. It is not, therefore, to cover
themselves from the imputation of schism, but
to authorize the vengeance, they meditate
against us, that we are stunned with the cry of
Antichrist and Babylon<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>To this charge, I can only reply, That, if
any Protestant writers have put that sense on
the words&mdash;<i>reward her, as she rewarded you</i>&mdash;they
must answer for their own temerity
and indiscretion. They, who understand themselves,
and the language of prophecy, disclaim
the odious imputation. They say, That they
neither admit the lawfulness of persecution in
any case, on the account of religion, nor have
the least thought of instigating the Christian
world to any sanguinary attempts against the
Papacy. What the <i>event</i> may be in the councils
of Providence, is another consideration:
But they neither avow, nor approve those principles,
which tend to produce it. They, further,
insist, That the two passages under consideration,
though, both of them, expressed in
the <i>imperative</i> form, require a very different
construction: That the language of prophecy
<i>seems</i> very often to authorise what it only
foretells; and to command that which it
barely permits: that, therefore, the sense
of such passages is to be determined by the
circumstances of the case; that, where obedience
is lawful, there the <i>preceptive</i> form may
be admitted; but, where it is not, there nothing
more is intended than the certainty of the
<i>event</i>: That this distinction is to be made in
the present case; for that Christianity doth not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
allow vindictive retaliations, or <i>holy wars</i>, for
the sake of religion, and that offensive arms
taken up in the cause of God (how confidently
soever some have justified their zeal by the authority
of the Jewish Law, ill-applied) are
abominable and <i>antichristian</i>: Whence we
rightly conclude, that&mdash;<i>reward her, as she
rewarded you</i>&mdash;are words not to be taken injunctively;
while those other words&mdash;<i>come
out of her, my people</i>&mdash;expressing nothing
but what it was previously our duty to do, are
very clearly to be so taken.</p>

<p>Lastly, We say, that the context in the two
places alledged, justifies this distinction. <i>Come
out of her, my people.</i> Why? <i>That ye be not
partakers, of her sins, and that ye receive not
of her plagues.</i> The reason is just, and satisfactory.
<i>Reward her.</i> Why? No reason is
assigned, or could be assigned consistently with
the spirit of the Christian religion: It only follows,
<i>as she has rewarded you</i>&mdash;words, which
express only the <i>measure</i>, and the <i>equitable
grounds</i> of the allotted punishment, not the
<i>duty</i> of Christians to inflict it.</p>

<p>I return, then, from the confutation of this
cavil (the most plausible, however, as well as
invidious, which the wit of Rome has started
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
on this subject) to the conclusion, before laid
down, That the completion of the Apocalyptic
prophecies in the Papal apostasy, if seen
and confessed, affords an unanswerable defence
and vindication of the Protestant churches.</p>

<p>This conclusion, that <span class="smcap">the Pope is Antichrist</span>,
and that other, that <span class="smcap">the scripture is
the sole rule of Christian faith</span>, were the
<i>two</i> great principles, on which the Reformation
was originally founded. How the <i>first</i> of these
principles came to be <small>DISGRACED</small> <i>among ourselves</i>,
I have shewn in another discourse<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>.
It may now be worth while to observe, in one
word, through what fatal mismanagement the
<i>latter</i> principle was even <i>generally</i> <small>DISAVOWED</small>
and <small>DESERTED</small>.</p>

<p>When the Reformers had thrown off all respect
for the Papal chair, and were for regulating
the faith of Christians by the sacred
scriptures, it still remained a question, <i>On
what grounds, those scriptures should be interpreted</i>.
The voice of the church, speaking
by her schoolmen, and modern doctors, was
universally, and without much ceremony, rejected.
But the Fathers of the primitive church
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
were still in great repute among Protestants
themselves; who dreaded nothing so much as
the imputation of novelty, which they saw
would be fastened on their opinions, and who,
besides, thought it too presuming to trust entirely
to the dictates of what was called <i>the
private spirit</i>. The church of Rome availed
herself with dexterity, of this prejudice, and
of the distress to which the Protestant party
was reduced by it. The authority of these ancient
and venerable interpreters was sounded
high by the Catholic writers; and the clamour
was so great and so popular, that the Protestants
knew not how, consistently with their
own principles, or even in mere decency, to
decline the appeal which was thus confidently
made to that tribunal. The Reformers, too,
piqued themselves on their superior skill in
ancient literature; and were ashamed to have
it thought that their adversaries could have any
advantage against them in a dispute, which
was to be carried on in that quarter. Other
considerations had, perhaps, their weight with
particular churches: But, for these reasons,
chiefly, all of them forwardly closed in with
the proposal of trying their cause at the bar of
the ancient church: And, thus, shifting their
ground, maintained henceforth, not that the
scriptures were the sole rule of faith, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
scriptures, <i>as interpreted by the primitive
fathers</i>.</p>

<p>When the state of the question was thus
changed, it was easy to see what would be the
issue of so much indiscretion. The dispute
was not only carried on in a dark and remote
scene, into which the people could not follow
their learned champions; but was rendered
infinitely tedious, and, indeed, interminable.
For those early writings, now to be considered
as of the highest authority, were voluminous
in themselves; and, what was worse, were
composed in so loose, so declamatory, and
often in so hyperbolical a strain, that no certain
sense could be affixed to their doctrines,
and any thing, or every thing, might, with
some plausibility, be proved from them.</p>

<p>The inconvenience was sensibly felt by the
Protestant world. And, after a prodigious
waste of industry and erudition, a learned foreigner<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>,
at length, shewed the inutility and
the folly of pursuing the contest any further.
In a well-considered discourse, <i>On the use of
the Fathers</i>, he clearly evinced, that their authority
was much less, than was generally supposed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
in <i>all</i> points of religious controversy;
and that their judgment was especially incompetent
in <i>those</i> points, which were agitated by
the two parties. He evinced this conclusion
by a variety of unanswerable arguments; and
chiefly by shewing that the matters in debate
were, for the most part, such as had never entered
into the heads of those old writers, being,
indeed, of much later growth, and having first
sprung up in the barbarous ages. They could
not, therefore, decide on questions, which they
had no occasion to consider, and had, in fact,
never considered; however their careless or
figurative expression might be made to look
that way, by the dextrous management of the
controversialists.</p>

<p>This discovery had great effects. It opened
the eyes of the more candid and intelligent inquirers:
And our incomparable Chillingworth,
with some others<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>, took the advantage of it to
set the controversy with the church of Rome,
once more, on its proper foot; and to establish,
for ever, the old principle, <span class="smcap">That the
Bible</span>, and that only, (interpreted by our best
reason) <span class="smcap">is the Religion of Protestants</span>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>Thus, <small>ONE</small> of the two pillars, on which the
Protestant cause had been established, was
happily restored. And, though Mr. Mede,
about the same time, succeeded as well in his
attempts to replace the <small>OTHER</small>, yet, through
many concurring prejudices, the merit of that
service hath not, hitherto, been so generally
acknowledged. Whether <i>the Pope be the Antichrist
of the prophets</i>, is still by some Protestants
made a question. Yet, it seems as if
it would not continue very long to be so: And
it may not be too much to expect, that this
institution will, hereafter, contribute to put
an end to the dispute.</p>

<p>The Reformation will, then, be secured
against the two invidious charges of <span class="smcap">Schism</span>
and <span class="smcap">Heresy</span> (for <i>neither</i> of which is there any
ground, if <i>the Pope be Antichrist</i>, and if <i>the
sole Rule of faith to a Christian be the canonical
scriptures</i>) and will, thus, stand immoveably
on its ancient and proper foundations.</p>

<p>In saying this, I do not, however, mean to
assert, that the Reformation has no support,
but in this principle&mdash;<i>that the Pope is Antichrist</i>.
There are various other considerations,
which are decisive in the controversy between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
us and the Papists. So that, if the prophecies
should, after all, be found to suit any other
person or power, better than the Roman Pontif,
we shall only have one argument the less
to urge against his pretensions, and the Protestant
cause, in the mean time, stands secure.
But, on the supposition that the prophecies
are rightly, and must be exclusively, applied
to the church of Rome (of which every man
will judge for himself, from the evidence hereafter
to be laid before him) on this supposition,
I say, it must be allowed that the shortest and
best defence of the Protestant cause is that
which is taken from the authority of those
prophecies, because they expressly enjoin a
separation from that society, to which they are
applied.</p>

<p>Ye perceive, then, in all views, the utility
of studying this prophecy of the <i>Revelations</i>,
provided there be reason to admit the completion
of it in the history of the Christian
Church, and particularly in the history of Papal
Rome. The <i>importance</i> and the <i>truth</i> of
Christianity will be seen in their full light&mdash;The
<i>wisdom</i> of the divine councils, in <i>permitting
the Apostacy to take place for a time</i>,
will be acknowledged&mdash;And the <i>honour</i> of
our common <i>Protestant profession</i> will be
effectually maintained.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>This Lecture is now brought down to that
point, from which, possibly, ye expected me
to set out. But, in the entrance on an argument,
new to many persons, and misunderstood
by most, it seemed expedient to take a
wide compass. The true <i>scriptural idea</i> of
the subject, was to be opened, at large<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>; the
<i>general argument</i> from prophecy, enforced<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>;
the <i>method</i> of the prophetic system deduced,
and further illustrated in a view of the prophecies
more immediately respecting the Christian
church<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>; Of <i>these</i> prophecies, those concerning
<i>Antichrist, or the apostasy of Papal
Rome</i>, were to be cleared of all prejudices and
objections<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>; and the <i>principles</i>, on which the
<i>Apocalyptic</i> prophecies, in particular, are to
be explained, proposed and justified<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a>: It was,
further, necessary to bespeak your attention to
the <i>argument</i> from the Apocalyptic prophecies,
especially, concerning Antichrist, by shewing
the several presumptions there are of its <i>force</i><a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
and by setting before you the <i>uses</i>, to which
this whole inquiry may be applied<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>.</p>

<p>This preliminary course, then, though it
has been tedious, will not be thought improper,
if it may serve, in any degree, to prepare and
facilitate the execution of the main design,
which is, <i>To interpret and apply particular
prophecies</i>: A work, of labour indeed; but
not unpleasant in itself; and (if carried on
with that diligence and sobriety, which are, in
reason, to be supposed) capable, I think, of
affording to fair and attentive minds the fullest
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The <small>SEASON</small>, I know, may be thought unfavourable
to such an attempt. For the main
stress must be laid on prophecies, about which
Christians themselves are not agreed, at a time
when the number of those persons is supposed
to be very great, and increasing every day,
who are not easily brought to acknowledge the
reality of <i>any</i> prophecies.</p>

<p>This <i>last</i> would be an unwelcome consideration,
if the fact were certain; I mean, if the
present state of religion were altogether such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
as some, perhaps, wish, and as others too
easily apprehend, it to be. But I hope, and
believe, it is not; the truth of the case, so far
as I am able to form a judgment of it, being
no more than this. A few fashionable men
make a noise in the world; and this clamour,
being echoed on all sides from the shallow circles
of their admirers, misleads the unwary
into an opinion, that the irreligious spirit is
universal and uncontroulable. Whereas, the
good and wise, are modest and reserved: having
no doubt themselves concerning the foundation
of their faith, they pay but little regard
to the cavils, which empty or corrupt men
throw out against it. They either treat those
cavils with a silent contempt; or, they lament
in secret the libertinism of the age, without taking
any vigorous measures to check and oppose
it. Besides, they rarely come into what is
called, <i>free company</i>; and they are too well
employed, and at the same time too well informed,
to hearken after every idle publication,
on the side of irreligion.</p>

<p>For these, and the like reasons, the number
of true believers is overlooked; or thought to
be less considerable than, in fact, it is, and
would presently be known to be, if a just estimate
were taken of them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span></p>

<p>Let me then, under this persuasion, express
myself in the spirit, and almost in the words,
of an ancient apologist<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>&mdash;“Let no man too
hastily despair of the cause, we are now
pleading. When we stand up in its defence,
there are those who will lend an ear to us.
For, whatever the vain, or the vicious may
pretend, the prophetic writings are not fallen
so low in the esteem of mankind, but that
there are numberless persons of good sense
and serious dispositions, who wish to see the
truth of the Gospel confirmed by them; and
are ready to embrace that truth, when fairly
set before them, and supported by the clear
evidence of historical testimony and well-interpreted
scripture.”</p>

<p>Such is the language, which I am not afraid
to hold to the desponding party among us.
But should my confidence, or my candour,
transport me too far, should even <i>their</i> apprehensions
be ever so well founded, the zeal of
those, who preach the Gospel, is not to abate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
but to exert itself with new vigour under so
discouraging a prospect. If there be a way
left to strike conviction into the hearts of unbelievers,
it must probably be, by pressing this
great point of prophetic inspiration, and by turning
their attention on a <i>miracle</i>, now wrought,
or ready to be wrought before their eyes. Or,
let the event be what it will, our duty is to illustrate
the word of prophecy, and to enforce
it; to withstand the torrent of infidelity with
what success we may, and, if it should prevail
over all our efforts, to make full proof, at least,
of our sincerity and good will.</p>

<p>In the mean time, it becomes all <i>others</i> to
retain and cultivate in themselves a respect for
the prophetic writings; which either are, or,
for any thing that has yet appeared, may be
divine. To treat them, without the fullest
conviction of their falshood, with neglect and
scorn, is plainly indecent, and may be highly
criminal and dangerous.</p>

<p>Josephus tells us, that, in the last dreadful
ruin of his unhappy countrymen, it was familiar
with them, <i>to make a jest of divine things,
and to deride, as so many senseless tales and
juggling impostures, the sacred oracles of</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
<i>their prophets</i><a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>; though they were then fulfilling
before their eyes, and even upon themselves.</p>

<p>But the case, perhaps, is different; and <i>we</i>
have no concern, in the prophecies concerning
Papal Rome.</p>

<p>What! Have <small>WE</small> no concern in those prophecies
(supposing, I mean, that they are prophecies,
at all, and, that there is reason for
applying them to the church of Papal Rome).
<span class="smcap">We</span>, who have but just been delivered from
the more than Egyptian bondage, which they
predict; and are, therefore, bound by every
tye of interest, of gratitude, and of charity,
to assert to ourselves, and to communicate to
others, as far as we are able, the blessings of
<i>that liberty, wherewith Christ has made us
free</i><a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>. Have <small>WE</small> no concern in the several
<i>uses</i>, mentioned in this discourse; and in
many others, which I have not mentioned; it
being well known, that <i>all inspired scripture</i>
(of which prophecy is so eminent a part) <i>is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction,
for instruction in righteousness</i><a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>Or, supposing that we had no <i>direct</i> concern
in these prophecies, and supposing, farther,
that the divine authority of them was
even <i>problematical</i>; still it may deserve to be
considered, I mean, by men the most libertine,
who have not yet convinced themselves,
by an exact and critical inquiry, of their utter
falshood and insignificancy; I say, it merits
the reflexion of all such, That the <i>contempt</i> of
the prophecies, under these circumstances, has
a natural tendency to corrupt the temper and
harden the heart. And is there no room to
question, whether this conduct, plainly an <i>immoral</i>
conduct, be adviseable or safe?</p>

<p>Let us then, on a principle of <i>self-love</i>, if
not of piety, <i>keep the sayings of this book</i>,
concerning <small>THE MAN OF SIN</small>. From many appearances,
the appointed time for the full completion
of them may not be very remote. And
it becomes our prudence to take heed that we
be not found in the number of those, to whom
that awful question is proposed&mdash;<i>How is it,
that ye do not discern the signs of this time?</i></p>

<p>Nay, there are prophecies, which, in that
case, may concern us more nearly, than we
think. St. Paul applied <small>ONE</small> of these, to the
unbelieving Jews; of whose mockery, and of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
whose fate, ye have heared what their own historian
witnesseth: And, if <i>we</i> equal their obdurate
spirit, <i>that</i> prophecy may clearly be <i>applied</i>,
and no man can say, that it was not <i>intended</i>
to be applied, to <i>ourselves</i>.</p>

<p><i>Beware therefore</i> (to sum up all in the tremendous
words of the Apostle<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>) <i>Beware, lest
that come upon you, which is spoken by the
Prophets</i>: <span class="smcap">Behold, ye despisers, and wonder
and perish; for I work a work in
your days, a work, which ye shall in no
wise understand, though a man declare
it unto you.</span>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Soon</span> after I had published this volume, I
received an anonymous Letter, addressed to
me at Thurcaston, of which the following is
an exact copy.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO DR. HURD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Some months ago it was reported, that Dr.
Hurd was preparing to expound the Apocalypsis,
and once more to prove the Pope to be
Antichrist. The public were amazed. By
the gay and by the busy world, the very attempt
was treated as an object of ridicule. Polite
scholars lamented, that you should be prevailed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
on to give up your more solid and liberal
studies, for such obscure and unprofitable researches.
Your own brethren of the church
hinted, that it would be far more prudent to
observe a respectful silence with regard to those
awful and invidious mysteries. A more than
common share of merit was requisite to surmount
such adverse prejudices. Your Sermons,
Sir, have been perused with pleasure by
many, who had the strongest dislike to the
name and subject. Every one has admired the
vastness of the plan, the harmony of the proportions,
and the elegance of the ornaments;
and if any have remarked a weakness in the
foundations, it has been imputed to the nature
of the ground; and the taste of the Patron has
been arraigned rather than the skill of the
Architect.</p>

<p>Since you have undertaken the care and defence
of this extensive province, I may be allowed,
less as an opponent than as a disciple,
to propose to you a few difficulties; about
which I have sought more conviction than I
have hitherto obtained. From the general
cast of your writings, I flatter myself that I
am speaking to a candid critic, and to a philosophical
divine; whose first passion is the love
of truth. On this pleasing supposition, let me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
venture to ask you, “<i>Whether, there is sufficient
evidence that the Book of Daniel is
really as ancient as it pretends to be.</i>” You
are sensible, that from this point the Golden
Chain of Prophecy, which you have let down
from Heaven to earth, is partly suspended.</p>

<p>There are two reasons which still force me
to with-hold my assent. I. The author of the
Book of Daniel is too well informed of the revolutions
of the Persian and Macedonian empires,
which are supposed to have happened
long after his death. II. He is too ignorant of
the transactions of his own times. In a word,
he is too exact for a Prophet, and too fabulous
for a contemporary historian.</p>

<p>I. The first of these objections was urged,
fifteen hundred years ago, by the celebrated
Porphyry. He not only frankly acknowledged,
but carefully illustrated the distinct and accurate
series of history, contained in the book of
Daniel, as far as the death of Antiochus Epiphanes;
for beyond that period, the author
seems to have had no other guide than the
dim and shadowy light of conjecture. The
four empires are clearly delineated, the expedition
of Xerxes into Greece, the rapid conquest
of Persia by Alexander, his untimely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
death without posterity, the division of his
vast monarchy into four kingdoms, one of
which, Egypt, is mentioned by name, their
various wars and intermarriages, the persecution
of Antiochus, the prophanation of the
Temple, and the invincible arms of the Romans,
are described with as much perspicuity
in the prophecies of Daniel, as in the histories
of Justin and Diodorus. From such a perfect
resemblance, the artful infidel would infer,
that both were alike composed after the event.
This conduct has supplied St. Jerom with a
fund of learning, and an occasion of triumph;
as if the philosopher, oppressed by the force of
truth, had unwarily furnished arms for his
own defeat. Yet, notwithstanding Jerom’s confidence,
and in spite of my inclination to side
with the father, rather than with the adversary
of the church; the reasoning of the latter may
I fear be justified by the rules of logic and
criticism.</p>

<p>May I not assume as a principle equally consonant
to experience, to reason, and even to
true religion; “That we ought not to admit
any thing as the immediate work of God,
which can possibly be the work of man; and
that whatever is said to deviate from the ordinary
course of nature, should be ascribed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
to accident, to fraud, or to fiction; till we
are fully satisfied, that it lies beyond the
reach of those causes?” If we cast away this
buckler, the blind fury of superstition, from
every age of the world, and from every corner
of the globe, will invade us naked and unarmed.</p>

<p>The eager trembling curiosity of mankind
has ever wished to penetrate into futurity; nor
is there perhaps any country, where enthusiasm
and knavery have not pretended to satisfy this
anxious craving of the human heart. These
self-inspired prophets have strove by various
arts to supply the want of a divine mission.
Sometimes adapting their conjectures to the
present situation of things, and to the passions
and prejudices of those, for whom their oracles
were intended, they have involved themselves
in the mystic veil of dark, general, and ambiguous
metaphors: and embracing an indefinite
space, they have trusted to time and fortune
for the accomplishment of their predictions,
or to the industry of kind commentators
for a favourable interpretation of them. Sometimes
they have commenced prophets, and even
true prophets at a very easy rate, by delivering
the narrative of things already past under the
name of some celebrated character of a distant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
age. As the series of events gradually unfolds
itself, those which the supposed ancient could
have read only in the book of fate, are transcribed
by the more enlightened modern from
any common history.</p>

<p>Virgil (the example is innocent and unexceptionable)
has left us specimens of both these
prophetic arts: I have often wondered at the
rashness of critics who have tryed to ascertain
the subject of the fourth Eclogue, and to point
out the wonderful infant, the restorer of a
golden age. That modest and judicious Poet
would not surely have risked the smallest part
of his reputation, on the miscarriage of a woman,
or the precarious life of a child. The
picture is richly, nay profusely coloured; but
the design is traced with so vague a pencil,
that it might adapt itself to any events or to
any interpretation; that it might equally suit a
literal or an allegorical sense; the son of Pollio,
of Antony, or of Augustus; the restoration
of liberty, or the tranquillity of the world
under one master. Far different are the prophecies
delivered to &AElig;neas concerning the fate
and fortunes of his descendants. The Trojan
hero is indulged with a full and distinct view
of the most remote futurity; and the visionary
prospect is closed by the mournful apparition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
of a youth, who would have rivalled the greatest
of his ancestors, had not the gods envied <i>such</i>
virtues to Rome and to mankind.</p>

<p>From this single remark, we should think
ourselves authorized to infer, that Virgil lived
in the Augustan age; and that the sixth book
was composed during the yet recent grief for
the loss of young Marcellus. The Poet indeed
meant not to deceive us: like the author of
the Persian Letters, or of the Moral Dialogues,
his only aim was to convey important truths
under the pleasing cover of fiction. But had
Virgil seriously pretended, that his sketch of
the Roman history was a faithful transcript
from an old Sibylline oracle; had Augustus
from motives of policy favoured the deceit,
and had the Romans adopted it with religious
respect; would any man of sense want better
evidence of the pious fraud, than the very clearness
and precision of the prophecy? The
unanimous judgment passed on the yet extant
collection of the Sibylline Oracles affords an
easy answer to this question. Every critic who
has observed that their prophetic light ceases
with the reign of Hadrian, has pronounced
them without hesitation to be a forgery of that
period.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span></p>

<p>However, as no Christian can dispute the
reality of Divine Inspiration, nor any philosopher
deny the possibility of it; the suspicion,
that a prophecy too clear and precise was composed
after the event, though extremely strong,
is capable of being removed by still stronger
positive evidence. Without insisting on any
fanciful or impracticable conditions, we have
(I think) a right to expect, that the existence
of such a prophecy prior to its accomplishment
should be proved, by the knowledge of it being
generally diffused amongst an enlightened nation,
previous to that period; and its public
existence attested, by an unbroken chain of
authentic writers. Till such evidence is produced,
we may fairly sit down in a calm and
well-grounded scepticism.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to form something like
this chain of witnesses in favour of the Book of
Daniel; but without being able to carry it
higher than the first century of the Christian
&aelig;ra. Josephus seems to expatiate with pleasure
on the praises of that great man; whose
character, in some instances, he proposed as a
model for his own. He celebrates the various
merit of Daniel, as a statesman, a prophet,
and even as an architect. His prophetic writings
(says Josephus) which are still extant,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
evince his familiar intercourse with the Deity,
and his perfect knowledge of futurity. He
even possessed some material advantages above
the rest of his inspired brethren; not contented
with declaring future events, he ascertains the
time when they were to happen; and instead
of announcing calamities, he is most commonly
the messenger of good news. The rise
and fall of successive empires so clearly described
and so punctually accomplished, ought
to convince the disciples of Epicurus, that human
affairs, instead of being left to the blind
impulsion of chance, are pre-ordained by an
all-directing Providence. Nothing can be desired
fuller or more honourable for Daniel than
this testimony of the Jewish historian. I am
only concerned that he did not publish his Antiquities
till the ninety-third year of the Christian
&aelig;ra; two hundred and fifty-seven years
after the death of Antiochus Epiphanes, and
more than six centuries later than the time, in
which the Prophet is supposed to have flourished.</p>

<p>II. The Book of Daniel is partly of the
prophetic and partly of the historic kind.
With the account of his visions, the author
mixes the memoirs of his life; which lies
the more open to our inspection, as it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
spent, not like those of the other Prophets
in caves and deserts, but in the courts of
princes and the great transactions of the world.
Three incidents are more particularly mentioned:
that he was educated with many other
captive youths, among the Eunuchs of Nebuchadnezzar;
that he was promoted by that
prince to the government of Babylon for the
interpretation of a dream; and that, under the
reign of Darius the Mede, he was appointed
the first of the three ministers or vizirs of the
empire; and was soon after exposed to the
most imminent danger, by the malice of his
enemies, the impudence of his sovereign, and
his own pious constancy. To the first of these
incidents I am so far from forming any objection,
that it seems to me, in the true style of
the oriental customs in war and government.
But the two last are embarrassed with difficulties,
from which I have not been able to extricate
myself.</p>

<p>1. Although the most unfrequented paths
have sometimes conducted the favourites of
fortune to wealth and honours: yet I much
doubt, whether any man has been appointed a
great officer of state for his skill in divination.
In the time of Chardin, the Persian astrologers
possessed as much credit at the court of the
Sophis, as the Chaldeans could possibly obtain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
in that of Babylon; and both king and people
paid the most implicit obedience to their predictions.
Two astrologers constantly attended
the Royal Person; nor was any measure adopted,
however trifling or however important, without
the previous sanction of these ministers of fate;
who cost the state annually above four millions
of French money. But notwithstanding they
were thus highly favoured and respected, they
were still confined within their own province;
nor is there any instance of the Sovereign chusing
his ministers, his generals, or his judges,
amongst that class of men; the best qualified,
as it should seem, for action, since they were
the best acquainted with the consequences of
their actions. The common sense of mankind
has constantly preferred the mere human accomplishments
of courage, capacity, and experience.
The Roman augurs indeed presided
in the senate, and led forth the armies
of the common-wealth; but in this single
exception, the sacerdotal was grafted on the
political character. The first citizens, after
rising gradually through the honours, and
great offices of their country, were at length
admitted to play the most powerful engine of
the aristocracy.</p>

<p>2. I am disposed to believe that the subsequent
merit of Daniel might justify the Monarch’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
caprice. I will allow, (on the credit
of the story of Susanna and the elders) that
there never was a Judge of hands more clean,
or of a more discerning eye; and that, in his
ministerial capacity, he was ever attentive to
the public interest, and careless of his own. I
cannot deny, that Daniel, as a favourite, as a
stranger, and as an honest man, must have
the whole court of Babylon for his enemies;
and am very sensible, that in the administration
of a great empire, the purest virtue and the most
shining abilities may afford room for misrepresentation
and calumny. How often must the
great Sully have yielded to those arts of courts,
had he not possessed a sure resource in the
sound understanding and generous heart of his
friend and master! The situation of the Jewish
and of the Huguenot Minister were somewhat
similar. Both were issued from an oppressed
race of obstinate sectaries; and it might be
deemed a very artful contrivance to invent
some test, which must force them to relinquish
their place, or their principles; to forfeit the
favour of their prince, or the confidence of
their party. Thus far the comparison is tolerably
exact. But the French ministers were
well assured that the fate and innocence of
Sully would be left to the common order of providence.
The courtiers of Darius must apprehend,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
that the piety of Daniel would be asserted
by a miraculous interposition. The
people of Babylon, not many years before,
had beheld the wonderful deliverance of
Daniel’s friends from the fiery furnace; and it
would have been a strange project for these crafty
statesmen, a second time to provoke the jealous
God of Israel, to exalt the glory of their
enemy, and to draw down destruction on their
own heads.</p>

<p>This age indeed, to whom the gift of miracles
has been refused, is apt to wonder at the
indifference with which they were received by
the ancient world. Instead of the instant terror,
lasting conviction, and implicit obedience,
we might rationally expect; the Jews as well
as the Gentiles conducted themselves, as if
they neither remembered nor believed the miracles
to which they were witnesses. Although
the hand of the Almighty was almost perpetually
employed in tracing out those divine characters;
they were no sooner formed, than
they were obliterated from the minds of men.
It may possibly be alledged, that faith was
distracted by the multiplicity of false as well
as of genuine miracles; whilst even the patrimony
of the Lord was encompassed by rival
deities.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>But this solution is more proper, I am afraid,
to aggravate than to alleviate the pressure of
the difficulty. Counterfeit money may pass
current with the true; since both are coined
by human hands and human industry: But I
have always considered Salmoneus imitating
Jove’s thunder by rattling with a brazen chariot
over a brazen bridge, as the most contemptible
legend in the whole compass of the Grecian
mythology.</p>

<p>3. The law of the Medes and Persians is
represented as a constitutional sanction, which
put it out of Darius’s power to revoke his rash
edict. Such legal restraints are the natural offspring
of free governments; but ill suit with
the genius of Asiatic despotism. From the
inaccessible solitude of a seven-fold palace the
king of the Medes disposed without controul
of the lives and property of his subjects: nor
does there exist a more dreadful act of authority,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
than the retaliation inflicted by Darius on
Daniel’s enemies; who, to the number of a
hundred and twenty, were cast, with their
wives and children, into the den of lions. If
the Persians enjoyed any degree of freedom
among their mountains, they became at the
same time slaves and conquerors; and a formal
determination of their judges stands recorded
by Herodotus. “That it was lawful for the
king to do whatever he pleased. There are
indeed some instances, where a wise despot
will check himself, and a foolish one will find
himself checked by the nature of things. Such
institutions as are derived from Divine authority,
ancient custom, or general opinion, cannot
be shaken without endangering the foundations
of his own throne. But it would be
truly unaccountable, that his cooler reason
should not be permitted to correct the passion
or surprize of a moment; and that the occasional
declarations of his pleasure should not
be annihilated by the same authority, which
produced them. May I not assert, that the
Greek writers who have so copiously treated of
the affairs of Persia, have not left us the
smallest vestige of a restraint, equally injurious
to the monarch, and prejudicial to the
people?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>4. The edict of Darius, “that during thirty
days, whosoever should ask any petition of
either god or man, save only of the king,
should be cast into the den of lions,” implied
an almost total suspension of religious
worship; which consists much more in prayer
than in thanksgiving. Such an extraordinary
interdict, by depriving the people of the comforts,
and the priests of the profits of religion,
must have diffused a general discontent throughout
his empire; which might easily have been
inflamed into sedition and civil war. With
what colours could the ministers of Darius
gloss over a measure big with every mischief,
and destitute of the smallest advantage? In
what language could they address themselves
to the reason, or even to the passions of their
Sovereign; who is described to be of an advanced
age, and a lover of justice and moderation?
But is there any character, which, with
the utmost latitude of supposition, may account
for this edict? An irreligious prince may be
indiscreet enough to treat with ridicule whatever
is held sacred by his subjects; but he will
entertain too great a contempt both for the
people, and for popular superstition, ever to
think of forcibly separating them from each
other. The bigot is actuated by a warmer
principle than the infidel; but his attachment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
to his own mode of worship rises in proportion
to his hatred of all others. Had Darius, as a
disciple of Zoroaster, shut up the temples of
the idolaters, he would have directed the fires
of the Magi to have blazed with redoubled ardour.
Even those tyrants who, destitute of
human virtues, have aspired to divine honours,
have grafted their pretensions on the established
religions. To be seated between Castor and
Pollux, to obtain the embraces of the Moon,
to confer with Jupiter of the Capitol, and to
place his image in the temple of Jerusalem,
would have gratified the wildest ambition of
Caligula. But to suspend during thirty days
the most universal propensity of mankind, is a
strain of wanton despotism unparalleled in the
history of the world; for the interdicts of the
Popes were of a quite different nature. They
were not the arbitrary prohibitions of a temporal
monarch; but a chastisement, inflicted by
the vicegerent of Christ, who excluded the offenders
from the benefits of Christianity, till
they had satisfied the Deity, offended in the
person of his ministers.</p>

<p>5. There yet remains a stronger, or at least
a more palpable objection, against the veracity
of the author of the book of Daniel: “The
high probability that Darius the Mede never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
existed; or, what amounts to the same, that
no prince of that name or nation reigned at
Babylon, between the time of Nebuchadnezzar
and that of Cyrus.” It would be to
little purpose to expatiate on the uncertainty
of ancient history, and the careless vanity of
the Greek writers. The outlines of the history
of Babylon are known to us with uncommon
precision. The Canon of Ptolemy contains the
stories of its kings, deduced from authentic records,
attested by astronomical observations,
and confirmed by the fragments of Berosus,
which are still extant in Josephus. Berosus
describes the conquests and buildings of Nebuchadnezzar,
and only omits to mention the
metamorphosis of that monarch into an ox.
His three immediate successors, were of his
own family; the fourth, Nabonadius, was a
Babylonian raised to the throne by the conspirators
who murdered his predecessor; and cast
down from it by the victorious arms of Cyrus
king of Persia. In this close series of the
Babylonian and Persian dynasties, there cannot
be found the smallest interval, which will
admit a Median prince.</p>

<p>Of the various expedients devised to elude
this difficulty, there is one only which can deserve
our notice; both as the most tolerable in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
itself, and as having been embraced by the
chronologists of the most distinguished merit
and reputation; by Usher, Prideaux, Sir Isaac
Newton, &amp;c. In their extreme distress, the
Cyaxares of Xenophon offered himself to their
imagination, as the properest person to support
the character of Darius the Mede. For
this purpose, they have supposed that he
reigned two years over the Babylonian empire;
after it had been subdued by the arms of Cyrus,
his nephew and his lieutenant. Such is their
hypothesis, which falls to the ground if the
Cyrop&aelig;dia is a romance; and is overthrown
by it, should that noble performance be received
as a genuine history.</p>

<p>1. Without insisting on the opinion of Plato
and Tully, I would rather appeal to your own
feelings; as I cannot doubt your familiar acquaintance
with the writings of the Attic Bee.
Compare the Anabasis with the Cyrop&aelig;dia;
and <i>feel</i> the difference between truth and fiction;
between the lively and copious variety of
the one, and the elegant poverty of the other.
A few general incidents, thinly scattered
through a diffuse work, and destitute of any
notes of geography or chronology, compose
the life of Cyrus; which seems lost in a multitude
of speeches, councils, reflections, and familiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
episodes. Xenophon was a philosopher
and a soldier; and if we unravel with any care
the fine texture of the Cyrop&aelig;dia, we shall
discover in every thread the Spartan discipline
and the philosophy of Socrates. The only
part which has the air of real history, is the
judicious digression, where Xenophon compares
the degeneracy of the modern Persians
with the wise institutions of their founder.
He possessed the best opportunities of examining
both the one and the other, whilst he
served in the camp of the younger Cyrus, and
traversed, with the immortal ten thousand, the
greatest part of the provinces of Artaxerxes.
The first Cyrus was confessedly a great man.
The conquest of Asia is a sufficient testimony
of his abilities; and the name of Father given
him by the Persians after his death, must
stand as the surest evidence of his virtues. But
the hero of the Cyrop&aelig;dia is drawn as a <i>perfect
character</i>; a monster as fabulous, and
less interesting than those of Ariosto. His
wise councils are never, in a single instance,
seduced by passion, misled by error, or disappointed
by accident. Xenophon labours to
establish the empire of prudence; his countryman
Herodotus had entertained himself with
displaying the tyranny of fortune; and both
writers, whilst they inculcate the moral precept,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
seem alike, though by opposite paths, to
deviate from historic truth.</p>

<p>2. But if the Cyrop&aelig;dia be admitted as a genuine
history, Darius the Mede is still excluded
from the throne of Babylon, since Cyaxares
himself never ascended it. When the Cyrus
of Xenophon besieged that great city, he had
gradually shaken off all dependance on his
uncle, and assumed to himself the supreme
command, and exclusive advantages of the
war. The strength of his army consisted of
seventy thousand natural Persians, solely attached
to their hereditary prince, from every
motive of duty, gratitude, and interest. He
was followed by a various train of nations, allies
and subjects, all subdued by his arms and
policy. About forty thousand Medes, who
served under his banners, had long since been
taught to despise the weakness, and to disobey
the commands of their sovereign. After the
conquest, Cyrus was solemnly inaugurated
king of Babylon, with every circumstance of
pomp and greatness, which could dazzle the
eyes of the multitude. Some time afterwards
he visited his uncle at Ecbatana, presented him
with rich gifts, the spoils of Asia, accepted his
only daughter in marriage, and very politely
told the King of the Medes, that he had set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
apart for him, one of the finest palaces of Babylon;
that whenever he should chuse to come
to that city, he might find himself, <i>as if he
were still in his own dominions</i>.</p>

<p>If these observations are founded in truth
and nature; it will follow, that the author of
the Book of Daniel has entertained us with incredible
stories, which happened under an
imaginary monarch. So much error and so
much fiction are incompatible with an inspired,
or even with a contemporary, writer. But if
the prophecies were framed three or four centuries
after the Prophet’s death, it was much
easier for the counterfeit Daniel to <i>foretel</i> great
and recent events, than to compose an accurate
history or probable romance of a dark and remote
period.</p>

<p>The question is curious in itself, important
in its consequences, and in every light worthy
the attention of a critical divine. This consideration
justifies the freedom of my address,

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>Your very elegant letter on the antiquity
and authenticity of the Book of Daniel (just
now received) finds me here, if not without
leisure, yet without books, and therefore in no
condition to enter far into the depths of this
controversy; which indeed is the less necessary,
as every thing, that relates to the subject,
will come, of course, to be considered by
my learned successors in the new Lecture.
For, as the prophecies of Daniel make an important
link in <i>that chain, which</i>, as you say,
<i>has been let down from heaven to earth</i> (but
not by the Author of the late Sermons, who
brought into view only what he had found, not
invented) the grounds, on which their authority
rests, will, without doubt, be carefully
examined, and, as I suppose, firmly established.</p>

<p>But, in the mean time, and to make at
least some small return for the civility of your
address to me, I beg leave to trouble you with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
two or three short remarks, such as occur to
me, on the sudden, in reading your letter.</p>

<p>Your main difficulties are these two: 1. That
the author of the Book of Daniel is too clear
for a prophet; as appears from his prediction
of the Persian and Macedonian affairs: And 2.
too fabulous for a contemporary historian; as
is evident, you suppose, from his mistakes,
chiefly, I think, in the vith chapter.</p>

<p>1. The first of these difficulties is an extraordinary
one. For why may not prophecy, if
the Inspirer think fit, be as clear as history?
Scriptural prophecy, whence your idea of its
obscurity is taken, is <i>occasionally</i> thus clear, I
mean after the event: And Daniel’s prophecy
of the revolutions in the Grecian empire would
have been obscure enough to Porphyry himself,
before it.</p>

<p>But your opinion, after all, when you come
to explain yourself, really is, as one should
expect, that, as a prophet, Daniel is not clear
enough: for you enforce the old objection of
Porphyry by observing, That, where a pretended
prophecy is clear to a certain point of
time, and afterwards obscure and shadowy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
there common sense leads one to conclude
that the author of it is an impostor.</p>

<p>This reasoning is plausible, but not conclusive,
unless it be taken for granted that a prophecy
must, in all its parts, be equally clear
and precise: whereas, on the supposition of
real inspiration, it may be fit, I mean it may
suit with the views of the Inspirer, to predict
some things with more perspicuity, and in
terms more obviously and directly applicable
to the events in which they are fulfilled, than
others. But, further, this reasoning, whatever
force it may have, has no place here; at
least, you evidently beg the question when you
urge it; because the persons, you dispute
against, maintain, That the subsequent prophecies
of Daniel are equally distinct with the
preceding ones concerning the Persian and
Macedonian empires, at least so much of them
as they take to have been fulfilled, and that, to
judge of the rest, we must wait for the completion
of them.</p>

<p>However, you admit that the suspicion arising
from the <i>clearest</i> prophecy may be removed
by direct positive evidence that it was
composed before the event. But then you
carry your notions of that evidence very far,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
when you require “that the existence of such
a prophecy prior to the accomplishment
should be proved by the knowledge of it
being generally diffused amongst an enlightened
nation, previous to that period, and its
public existence attested by an unbroken
chain of authentic writers.”</p>

<p>What you here claim as a matter of <i>right</i>,
is, without question, very desirable, but should,
I think, be accepted, if it be given at all, as a
matter of courtesy. For what you describe is
the utmost evidence that the case admits: but
what right have we, in this or any other subject
whether of natural or revealed religion, to
the utmost evidence? Is it not enough that
the evidence be sufficient to induce a reasonable
assent? And is not that assent reasonable,
which is paid to real evidence, though of
an inferior kind, when uncontrouled by any
greater? And such evidence we clearly have
for the authenticity of the book of Daniel, in
the reception of it, by the Jewish nation,
down to the time of Jesus, whose appeal to it
supposes and implies that reception to have
been constant and general: Not to observe that
the testimony of Jesus is further supported by
all the considerations that are alledged for his
own divine character. To this evidence, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
is positive so far as it goes, you have nothing
to oppose, but surmise and conjecture, that is,
nothing that deserves to be called evidence.
But I doubt, Sir, you take for granted, that
the claim of inspiration is never to be allowed,
so long as there is a possibility of supposing
that it was not given.</p>

<p>II. In the second division of your Letter,
which is longer and more laboured than the
first, you endeavour to shew that the <i>historical</i>
part of the book of Daniel, chiefly that of the
sixth chapter, is false and fabulous, and, as
such, confutes and overturns the <i>prophetical</i>.
What you say on this head is contained under
<i>five</i> articles.</p>

<p>1. You think it strange that Daniel, or any
other man, should be advanced to a great office
of state, <i>for his skill in divination</i>.</p>

<p>But here, first, you forget that Joseph was
thus advanced, and for the same reason: Or,
if you object to this instance, what should
hinder the advancement either of Joseph or
Daniel (when their skill in divination had once
brought them into the notice and favour of
their sovereign) for what you call <i>mere human
accomplishments</i>? For such assuredly both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
these great men possessed, if we may believe
the plain part of their story, which asserts of
Joseph, and indeed proves, that he was, in no
common degree, <i>discreet and wise</i>; and of
Daniel, that <i>an excellent spirit was found in
him</i>, nay that he had <i>knowledge and skill in
all learning and wisdom</i>, over and above his
<i>understanding in all visions and dreams</i>. In
short, Sir, though princes of old might not
make it a rule to chuse their ministers out of
their soothsayers, yet neither would their being
soothsayers, if they were otherwise well accomplished,
prevent them from being ministers:
Just as in modern times, though churchmen
have not often, I will suppose, been made
officers of state, even by bigotted princes, because
they were churchmen, yet neither have
they been always set aside from serving in those
stations, when they have been found eminently
qualified for them.</p>

<p>2. Your next exception is, That a combination
could scarce have been formed in the
court of Babylon against the favourite minister
(though such factions are common in other
courts) because the courtiers of Darius <i>must
have apprehended that the piety of Daniel
would be asserted by a miraculous interposition</i>;
of which they had seen a striking instance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
And here, Sir, you expatiate with a
little too much complacency on the strange indifference
which the ancient world shewed to
the gift of miracles. You do not, I dare say,
expect a serious answer to this charge; Or, if
you do, it may be enough to observe, what I
am sure your own reading and experience must
have rendered very familiar to you, that the
strongest belief or conviction of the mind perpetually
gives way to the inflamed selfish passions;
and that, when men have any scheme
of interest or revenge much at heart, they are
not restrained from pursuing it, though the
scaffold and the axe stand before them in full
view, and have perhaps been streaming but
the day before with the blood of other state-criminals.
I ask not, whether miracles have ever
<i>actually</i> existed, but whether you do not think
that multitudes have been firmly <i>persuaded</i> of
their existence: And their indifference about
them is a fact which I readily concede to you.</p>

<p>3. Your third criticism is directed against
what is said of <i>the law of the Medes and Persians,
that it altereth not</i>; where I find nothing
to admire, but the extreme rigour of
Asiatic despotism. For I consider this irrevocability
of the law, when once promulgated by
the Sovereign, not as contrived to be a check
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
on his will, but rather to shew the irresistible
and fatal course of it. And this idea was so
much cherished by the despots of Persia, that,
rather than revoke the iniquitous law, obtained
by surprize, for exterminating the Jews,
Ahasuerus took the part, as we read in the
book of Esther, (and as Baron Montesquieu, I
remember, observes) to permit the Jews to defend
themselves against the execution of it.
Whence we see how consistent this law is with
the determination of the Judges, quoted by you
from Herodotus&mdash;“That it was lawful for the
King to do whatever he <i>pleased</i>”&mdash;for we understand,
that he did not please, that his law,
when once declared by him, should be altered.</p>

<p>You add, under this head, “May I not assert,
that the Greek writers, who have so copiously
treated of the affairs of Persia, have
not left us the smallest vestige of a restraint,
equally injurious to the monarch, and prejudicial
to the people?” I have not the Greek
writers by me to consult; but a common book
I chance to have at hand, refers me to one
such vestige in a very eminent Greek Historian,
Diodorus Siculus. Lowth’s Comm. in loc.</p>

<p>4. A fourth objection to the historic truth
of the book of Daniel is taken, with more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
plausibility, from the matter of this law,
which, as you truly observe, was very strange
for the King’s councillors to advise, and for
any despot whatsoever to enact.</p>

<p>But 1. I a little question whether prayer
was so constant and considerable a part of Pagan
worship, as is supposed; and, if it was not,
the prejudices of the people would not be so
much shocked by this interdict, as we are
ready to think. Daniel indeed prayed three
times a day: but the idolaters might content
themselves with praying now and then at a
stated solemnity. It is clear that when you
speak of <i>depriving men of the comforts, and
the priests of the profits of religion</i>, you have
Christian and even modern principles and manners
in your eye: perhaps, in the <i>comforts</i>,
you represented to yourself a company of poor
inflamed Huguenots under persecution; and,
in the <i>profits</i>, the lucrative trade of Popish
masses. But, be this as it may, it should be
considered, 2. that this law could not, in the
nature of the thing, suppress all prayer, if the
people had any great propensity to it. It
could not suppress <i>mental</i> prayer: it could
not even suppress <i>bodily worship</i>, if performed,
as it easily might be, in the night,
or in secret. Daniel, it was well known, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
used to pray in open day-light, and in a
place exposed to inspection from his usual
manner of praying; which manner, it was easily
concluded, so zealous a votary, as he was, would
not change or discontinue, on account of the
edict. Lastly, though the edict passed for thirty
days, to make sure work, yet there was no
doubt but the end proposed would be soon accomplished,
and then it was not likely that
much care would be taken about the observance
of it.</p>

<p>All this put together, I can very well conceive
that extreme envy and malice in the
courtiers might suggest the idea of such a law,
and that an impotent despot might be flattered
by it. Certainly, if what we read in the third
chapter be admitted, That <i>one</i> of these despots
required all people, nations, and languages to
worship his image on pain of death, there is
no great wonder that <i>another</i> of them should
demand the exclusive worship of himself, for
a month<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>; nay perhaps he might think himself
civil, and even bounteous to his gods, when
he left them a share of the other eleven. For,
as to the presumption&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;Nihil est quod credere de se<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non possit, cui laudatur Diis &aelig;qua potestas.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span></p>

<p>5. A fifth, and what you seem to think the
strongest objection to the credit of the book of
Daniel, is, “That no such person, as Darius
the Mede, is to be found in the succession of
the Babylonish princes [You mean, as given
in Ptolemy’s Canon and the Greek writers]
between the time of Nebuchadnezzar and that
of Cyrus.”</p>

<p>In saying this, you do not forget, nor disown,
what our ablest chronologers have said on
the subject: But then you object, that Xenophon’s
Cyaxares has been made, (to serve a
turn) to personate Darius the Mede, and yet
that Xenophon’s book, whether it be a romance,
or a true history, overturns the use
which they have made of this hypothesis.</p>

<p>1. I permit myself, perhaps, to be too
much flattered by your civility in referring me
to my own taste, rather than to the authority
of Cicero: But the truth is, I am much disposed
to agree with you, “that, if we unravel
with any care the fine texture of the Cyrop&aelig;dia,
we shall discover in every thread the
Spartan discipline and the philosophy of Socrates.”
But then, as the judicious author
chose to make so recent a story as that of
Cyrus, and so well known, the vehicle of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
political and moral instructions, he would be
sure to keep up to the <i>truth</i> of the story, as
far as might be; especially in the leading facts,
and in the principal persons, as we may say,
of the drama. This obvious rule of decorum
such a writer, as Xenophon, could not fail to
observe: And therefore, on the supposition that
his Cyrop&aelig;dia is a romance, I should conclude
certainly that the outline of it was genuine
history.</p>

<p>But, 2. if it be so, you conclude that there
is no ground for thinking that Darius the Mede
ever reigned at Babylon, because Cyaxares
himself never reigned there.</p>

<p>Now, on the idea of Xenophon’s book being
a romance, there might be good reason for the
author’s taking no notice of the short reign of
Cyaxares; which would break the unity of his
work, and divert the reader’s attention too
much from the hero of it: while yet the omission
could hardly seem to violate historic truth,
since the lustre of his hero’s fame, and the real
power which, out of question, he reserved to
himself, would make us easily forget or overlook
Cyaxares. But, as to the <i>fact</i>, it seems
no way incredible, that Cyrus should concede
to his royal ally, his uncle, and his father-in-law
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
(for he was all these) the <i>nominal</i> possession of
the sovereignty&mdash;or that he should <i>share</i> the
sovereignty with him&mdash;or, at least, that he
should leave the <i>administration</i>, as we say, in
his hands at Babylon, while he himself was
prosecuting his other conquests at a distance.
Any of these things is supposable enough; and
I would rather admit any of them, than reject
the express, the repeated, the circumstantial
testimony of a not confessedly fabulous historian.</p>

<p>After all, Sir, I doubt, I should forfeit your
good opinion, if I did not acknowledge that
some, at least, of the circumstances, which
you have pointed out, are such as one should
hardly expect at first sight. But then such is
the condition of things in this world; and what
is <i>true</i> in human life is not always, I had almost
said, not often, that which was to be previously
expected: whence, an indifferent romance
is, they say, more <i>probable</i> than the
best history. But should any or all of these
circumstances convince you perfectly that some
degree of error or fiction is to be found in the
book of Daniel, it would be too precipitate to
conclude that therefore the whole book was of
no authority. For, at most, you could but
infer, that the historical part, in which those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
circumstances are observed, namely the sixth
chapter, is not genuine: Just as hath been adjudged,
you know, of some other pieces, which
formerly made a part of the book of Daniel.
For it is not with these collections, which go
under the name of the prophets, as with some
regularly connected system, where a charge of
falsehood, if made good against one part of it,
shakes the credit of the whole. Fictitious histories
may have been joined with true prophecies,
when all that bore the name of the same
person, or any way related to him, came to be
put together in the same volume: But the detection
of such misalliance could not affect the
prophecies, certainly not those of Daniel, which
respect <i>the latter times</i>; for these have an intrinsic
evidence in themselves, and assert their
own authenticity in proportion as we see, or
have reason to admit, the accomplishment of
them.</p>

<p>And now, Sir, I have only to commit these
hasty reflections to your candour; a virtue,
which cannot be separated from the love of
truth, and of which I observe many traces in
your agreeable letter. And if you would indulge
this quality still further, so as to conceive
the possibility of that being <i>true and reasonable</i>,
in matters of religion, which may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
seem strange, or, to so lively a fancy as your’s,
even ridiculous, you would not hurt the credit
of your excellent understanding, and would
thus remove one, perhaps a principal, occasion
of <i>those mists which</i>, as you complain, <i>hang
over these nice and difficult subjects</i>.</p>

<p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I should not perhaps have thought it worth
while to print either of these Letters, if a noble
person had not made it necessary for me to
give the <i>former</i> to the publick, by doing this
honour (though without my leave or knowledge)
to the <i>latter</i>. By which means, however,
we are now at length informed (after the
secret had been kept for twice twelve years)
that the anonymous Letter-writer was Edward
Gibbon, Esq. afterwards the well-known author
of “The History of the <i>Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire</i><a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span></p>

<p>Of Mr. Gibbon’s Letter to me, I have no
more to say: And of his <i>History</i>, only what
may be expressed in few words.</p>

<p>It shews him, without doubt, to have possessed
parts, industry, and learning; each in
a degree that might have entitled him to a respectable
place among the compilers of ancient
history. But these talents were disgraced, and
the fruit of them blasted, by a <small>FALSE TASTE OF
COMPOSITION</small>: that is, by <i>a raised, laboured,
ostentatious style</i>; effort in writing being mistaken,
as it commonly is, for energy&mdash;by <i>a
perpetual affectation of wit, irony, and satire</i>;
generally misapplied; and always out of place,
being wholly unsuited to the historic character&mdash;and,
what is worse, by a <i>free-thinking libertine
spirit</i>; which spares neither morals nor
religion; and must make every honest man regard
him as a bad citizen, as well as writer.</p>

<p>These miscarriages may, all of them, be
traced up to one common cause, an <small>EXCESSIVE
VANITY</small>.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibbon survived, but a short time, his
favourite work. Yet he lived long enough to
know that the most and best of his readers
were much unsatisfied with him. And a few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
years more may, not improbably, leave him
without one admirer.&mdash;Such is the fate of
those, who will write themselves into fame, in
defiance of all the principles of true taste, and
of true wisdom!</p>

<p>The <i>former</i> appears to be the sense, for the following
reasons.</p>

<p>1. The point asserted, is, “That the Angel, who had
delivered this illustrious prophecy, was <i>the fellow-servant of
John</i>, and not of John only, but <i>of those who have the
testimony of Jesus</i>.” The proof is&mdash;<i>for the spirit of prophecy
is the testimony of Jesus</i>&mdash;i. e. the end of prophecy
is to bear testimony, or, to do honour, to Jesus; therefore,
I, says the Angel, who am endowed with this prophetic
spirit, am but employed, as thou art; who, in
thy character of Apostle or Evangelist, hast received the
same general commission, namely, to bear testimony, or
to do honour, to Jesus. See Acts x. 42. We are, therefore,
<i>fellow-servants</i>, or joint labourers in the same cause.
All this is clear and well-reasoned. But, now, take the
words&mdash;<i>the testimony of Jesus</i>&mdash;in the sense of&mdash;<i>the
testimony given by Jesus</i>&mdash;and how does the Angel’s having
<i>the spirit of prophecy</i>, prove him to be <i>a fellow-servant
of John</i>? for the reason assigned will then stand thus&mdash;<i>for
the spirit of prophecy is the testimony which Jesus gives
of himself</i>. The inference is, that the Angel was a true
prophet. Again: how is the Angel proved, in this way,
to be <i>the fellow-servant of those who have the testimony of
Jesus</i>? Why, thus; the Angel had the spirit of prophecy,
and prophecy was the gift of Christ; therefore he was the
fellow-servant of those, who had the same gift, i. e. who
were prophets. Without doubt. But why so strange a
way of proving so plain a point? It had been enough to
say&mdash;<i>I am a prophet, as others are</i>. Still, what was this
to St. John? who, in this place, is not sustaining the character
of a prophet; for the worship he was inclined to
pay the Angel was on account of the Angel’s being, what
himself was not, <i>a prophet</i>.</p>

<p>Turn it which way you will, the reasoning is frivolous,
or inconsequent. I conclude therefore, that not <i>this</i>, but
the <i>other</i> interpretation gives the true sense of&mdash;<i>the testimony
of Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>2. To speak of <i>prophecy</i> under the idea of <i>a testimony
to, or concerning Jesus</i>, is conforming to the true scriptural
idea of that gift. Thus we are told that&mdash;<i>to him</i> [i. e.
to Jesus] <i>give all the prophets witness</i>&mdash;τούτῳ πάντες προφῆται
μαρτυροῦσιν, Acts x. 43. <i>Prophecy</i>, therefore, being the
thing here spoken of, is rightly called the testimony, or
witness to, or concerning Jesus.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, the construction is fully justified, 1. by observing
that the genitive case [as here Ἰησοῦ] is frequently
used in scripture, not actively, but passively. See a variety
of instances in Mede, p. 626, where he explains
διδασκαλίαι δαιμονίων: And 2. by referring the reader to the
following passage of St. Paul, where the very expression
of the text is so used&mdash;μὴ οὖν ἐπαισχυνθῇς τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ Κυρίου
ἡμῶν&mdash;clearly, <i>be not ashamed of bearing testimony to
our Lord</i>, 2 Tim. i. 8.&mdash;and to Rev. i. 9. where the Apostle
tells us, he was in the isle of Patmos&mdash;διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ
Θεοῦ, καὶ διὰ τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ Χριϛοῦ&mdash;<i>on account of his
having been faithful in preaching the word of God, and in
bearing testimony to Jesus Christ</i>&mdash;and still more plainly,
if possible, and indubitably, by referring him to Rev. xii.
17. where, speaking of the Dragon, he says, he went in
wrath to make war on those, <i>which keep the commandments
of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ</i>&mdash;τῶν τηρούντων
τὰς ἐντολὰς τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἐχόντων τὴν μαρτυρίαν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ Χριϛοῦ: for
these objects of the Dragon’s fury are properly, <small>THE WITNESSES</small>,
those faithful servants of truth, who suffered for
the courageous and persevering <i>testimony</i>, they gave, in
evil times, to Jesus Christ, and to his pure religion.</p>

<p>On the whole, there cannot be the least doubt of the
interpretation here given of this famous text. The <i>expression</i>
fairly admits this interpretation; and (what the
true critic will regard most) the <i>scope</i> of the place, or pertinence
of the reasoning, addressed to St. John, admits
no other.</p></div>

Coloss. ii. 17. Hence, St. Austin affirms roundly,
“That, to such as consider the genius of the revealed system,
the Old Testament must appear a continued prophecy
of the New.”&mdash;<i>Vetus Testamentum</i>, rect&egrave; <i>sentientibus</i>,
<small>PROPHETIA</small> <i>est Novi Testamenti</i> [<i>contr. Faustum</i>, l.
xv.]: and St. Jerom speaks of it as a generally-received
maxim, “That it is the manner of sacred scripture, to
deliver, beforehand, the truth of futurity, in types”&mdash;<i>hunc
esse morem scriptur&aelig; sanct&aelig; ut futurorum veritatem
pr&aelig;mittat</i>, in <small>TYPIS</small> [Hieron. T. III. 1127.]&mdash;I know,
that the ancient Fathers, and from them many moderns,
have exposed themselves to much and deserved censure, by
pursuing this principle too minutely and superstitiously,
in their mystical and allegorical comments on the Jewish
scriptures. But men of sense will consider, that a principle
is not therefore to be rejected, because it has been
abused. For instance, that the Passover was instituted
with a reference to the sacrifice of Christ, that the paschal
Lamb was, in the language of St. Austin, a <i>prophecy</i>, or,
in that of St. Jerom, a <i>type</i>, of the lamb of God, will
seem highly credible to one who considers the aptness of
the correspondence in two related parts of the same system:
But, that the famous Law in Deuteronomy, concerning
the marriage of a brother’s widow, was <i>prophetic</i>, or <i>typical</i>
of the duty, incumbent on the ministers of the Gospel,
to espouse the widowed church of Christ, is certainly much
less clear, and will scarcely be admitted even on the authority
of St. Austin.&mdash;Hoc ipsum&mdash;quod uxorem fratris
ad hoc frater jussus est ducere, ut non sibi, sed illi sobolem
suscitaret, ejusque vocaret nomine, quod inde nasceretur:
quid aliud <i>in figur&acirc; pr&aelig;monstrat</i>, nisi quia unusquisque
Evangelii pr&aelig;dicator ita debet in Ecclesi&acirc; laborare,
ut defuncto fratri, hoc est Christo, suscitet semen, qui pro
nobis mortuus est, et quod suscitatum fuerit, ejus nomen
accipiat? <i>Contr. Faustum</i>, l. 32.&mdash;St. Austin might, perhaps,
say for himself, that he had an example of this practice
in the mystical comments of St. Paul: it may be so:
but an <i>example</i>, followed without warrant, in this instance,
by the learned Father, and, not improbably, ill understood
by him.</p></div>

Yet hear in how decisive a tone a certain writer, of
no small account with the infidel party, reprobates this
argument:&mdash;“Je dis de plus, qu’aucune proph&eacute;tie ne
sauroit faire autorit&eacute; pour moi.” [Rousseau, Œuvres,
T. III. p. 156. La Haye, 1762.] “I say,” says Mr. Rousseau,
“that the argument from prophecy can have no
weight with me.” If you ask his reason, it follows.
“Because, to give it any authority, three conditions are
required, the concurrence of which is impossible. First,
I must have been, myself, a witness of the prophecy,
when delivered. Secondly, I must have been, myself; a
witness of the event: And lastly, I must have it demonstrated
to me that the agreement between the prophecy
and the event could not have been fortuitous. For
though the prophecy were clearer, and more precise,
than a geometrical axiom, yet as the clearness of a prediction,
made at hazard, does not render the accomplishment
of it impossible, this accomplishment, allowing
it to take place, proves nothing, strictly speaking,
in favour of the person who foretold it.”</p>

<p>First, he says, <i>He must himself have been a witness of the
prophecy</i>. But why so? Is there no way of being reasonably
assured that a prophecy has been delivered, unless
one has been actually present at the delivery of it? Does
any one doubt, whether Socrates told his friend that he
should die within three days’ time, because he did not hear
these words from the mouth of the philosopher? But,
there is less reason still to doubt whether Jesus uttered the
prophecies, ascribed to him in the Gospel.</p>

<p>Next, <i>He must have been, himself, a witness of the event</i>.
With just as good reason, as of the prophecy. However,
it so happens that we are, or may be, if we please, witnesses
of the events, foretold in many prophecies. What
does he think of the dispersion of the Jews, for instance?
Is he not a witness of this event?</p>

<p>But lastly, <i>He must have it demonstrated to him that the
agreement between the prophecy and the event could not have
been fortuitous</i>. What, will nothing less than <i>demonstration</i>
satisfy him? Will not a high degree of probability
serve him to form a conclusion upon, nay, and to regulate
his conduct? And will he stand out against the strongest
degree of evidence, short of mathematical, or a proof <i>&agrave; la
rigueur</i>, as he terms it, in a subject, where, from the nature
of it, mathematical certainty is not to be had?</p>

<p>Surely one needs be no great philosopher to see that all
which is wanting to give authority to the argument from
prophecy, is, That we have <i>reason</i> to admit the delivery of
a prediction&mdash;that we have <i>reason</i> to admit the completion
of it&mdash;and that we have reason to think the agreement
between the prediction and the event not fortuitous.
And where is the impossibility that these three reasons
should concur?&mdash;It is plain that the only one of these
three reasons that appears in any degree problematical is
the last concerning the completion of a prophecy in its
event, whether it be fortuitous or not. Have I not reason
then to say, as I do below p. 81, 82, that the strength of
the infidel cause lies in this last consideration?&mdash;But what
that strength is, we shall see as we go along.</p></div>

<i>rise from the dead</i>, within <i>three days</i> after his crucifixion.

might be a sagacious conjecture. Can it be said

<i>The Lord himself shall give you a sign</i>, Isai. vii. 14.&mdash;This
<small>SIGN</small> (and the extraordinary introduction of it, in the
words quoted, indicates no less) had plainly a recondite
and even complicated meaning!</p>

<p>1. As addressed to <i>Ahaz</i>, it was simply an <small>ASSURANCE</small>,
that his deliverance from his two great enemies was now
at hand.</p>

<p>2. As addressed to the <i>house of David</i>&mdash;<i>Hear ye now,
O house of David</i>&mdash;it was a <small>TYPE</small> of Christ.</p>

<p>3. It was, farther, a <small>TOKEN</small>, or pledge, that the remote
deliverance of the house of David by Immanuel,
should hereafter take place, just as the approaching deliverance
of Ahaz, by the prophet’s Son, would be seen
to do.</p>

<p>4. This sign, when fulfilled in the near event, would,
thenceforward, become a <small>PROOF</small>, or evidence, that it
would be fulfilled in the remote one.</p>

<p>5. Lastly, in the Antitype, the sign was a <small>MIRACLE</small>,
properly so called.</p>

<p>So eminently was this Child, a <small>SIGN</small>! A <i>sign</i>, in all the

and to all the <i>purposes</i>, for which signs were given.</p></div>

What the Philosopher Celsus thought of such a project,
we learn from a curious passage in Origen. It being
usual with the Christians of that time, as of every other,
<i>to pray for the conversion of the whole world to the Christian
faith</i>, the philosopher laughs at the extravagance of
this petition. He observes upon it, ὅτι ὁ τοῦτο οἰόμενος οἶδεν
οὐδέν. The words are not easily translated. But the <i>meaning</i>
of them is, That he regarded an universal agreement
in one mode of religious belief, as a perfect chim&aelig;ra: and
the <i>turn</i> of the words is so contrived, as to express the utmost
contempt of those, who, in their supreme ignorance
of mankind, could entertain so senseless an idea. <i>Contr.

Could it be <i>foreseen</i>, that nothing of this sort would
happen? When the <i>Reformation</i> was set on foot in Germany,
Luther and his adherents resolved to carry it on in
the spirit of the Gospel, that is, by <i>pacific measures</i>. But
how soon did passion and policy strike in, to drive them
from this purpose! The Catholics were intolerant: the
Reformed grew powerful: and then, what was too naturally
to be expected, followed.</p>

<p>If it be said, that the Gospel hath not been always propagated,
<i>without force</i>; I acknowledge, it has not: but
then I observe, 1. that it was incontestably so propagated,
till the conversion of the Roman empire; in which event,
alone, the prophecies appear to have had a reasonable
completion. 2. that the <i>force employed</i>, has generally
been the force of one Christian sect, directed against some
other (in which scandalous contentions the prophecies
have no concern), not in the propagation of Christianity
itself in unbelieving countries. 3. that the <i>way of force</i>,
when professedly used against unbelievers, though, in
<i>some</i> cases, it has contributed to the enlargement of
Christ’s kingdom, has yet, in <i>others</i> (where, too, the utmost
force and zeal were combined) very signally failed of
success; of which the <i>crusades against the Mahometans</i> afford
a striking instance: and 4. lastly, that we expect the
<i>final universal</i> prevalence of the Christian faith from the
same spiritual arms only, which were first employed with
such success in the propagation of it.</p></div>

An eminent writer, with the view, indeed, of disgracing
the Reformation, hath set this matter in a very
just light: “Que nos freres, says he, ouvrent donc les
yeux; qu’ils les jettent sur l’ancienne Eglise, qui durant
tant de si&eacute;cles d’une persecution si cruelle ne s’est jamais
&eacute;chap&eacute;e, ni un seul moment, ni dans un seul homme, &amp;
qu’on a v&ucirc;&euml; aussi so&ucirc;mise sous Diocletien, et m&ecirc;me sous
Julien l’apostat, lorsqu’elle remplissoit deja toute la terre,
que sous Neron &amp; sous Domitien, lorsqu’elle ne faisoit que
de naitre: <span class="smcap">c’est la qu’on voit veritablement le doigt
de Dieu</span>.”<br />

<span class="author"><i>Hist. des Variations</i>, l. x. c. 53.</span></p>

<p><i>The finger of God</i>, as the learned writer says, was indeed
conspicuous in this conduct of the primitive Christians,
because it fulfilled the prophecies (so unlikely to be
fulfilled) concerning the <i>manner</i> in which Christianity was
to obtain an establishment in the world. If the conduct of
the <i>reformed</i> had not this merit, it was because the prophecies
did not extend to the reformation of Christian religion,
but to the introduction and first settlement of it.
The agents, in this last work of Providence, were therefore
left to the natural influence of their passions, and
they acted too frequently as those passions impelled them.</p>

<p>For the rest, how far the <i>general</i> precepts of the Gospel
require a passive submission and non-resistance to outrageous
intolerance, whether absolutely, and in all cases,
is a point of nice discussion; in which I take no part, at
present, because I am not now making the apology of the
<i>reformed</i>, but shewing the completion of the prophecies concerning
the <i>propagators</i> of Christianity: and the wonder
to see them so punctually completed, is not lessened, but
increased, by supposing, that the precepts of the Gospel
leave mankind to the free use of their natural rights, in
the case of extreme violence and injustice.</p></div>

commentator did not reflect, that words are not always
used according to the strict import of their etymologies.
<i>False Christs</i>, we will say, are, in the strict sense of the
word, <i>Antichrists</i>. But the question is, in <i>what</i> sense this
word is used of the person called, by way of eminence,
<span class="smcap">The Antichrist</span>. This must be collected from the attributes
given to him in the prophecies themselves, not
from the rigorous etymology of the term. The case was
plainly this. St. John is speaking of the <i>false Christs</i>, who
had appeared in his time; and, to disgrace them the
more effectually in the minds of those to whom he writes,
he brands them with the name of <i>Antichrists</i>: not so much
respecting the exact sense of the word, as the ideas of
aversion, which, he knew, it would excite. For the tradition
of the church concerning <i>Antichrist</i>, had made this

[<i>Serm. sup. Cantic.</i> xxxiii.]&mdash;It is true, by Antichrist, he
seems not to mean the Pope, but, in general, an evil principle,
which then domineered in the church. Yet he refers
us to the famous passage in the first Epistle to the
Thessalonians, ch. ii. And he tells us in his 56th epistle,
that he had heard one Norbert, a man of exemplary piety,
say, That Antichrist would be revealed in that age. Hence it
seems probable, that some one person or power was in his
eye. After all, he says, that Norbert’s reasons did not
satisfy him. Yet, in another epistle, he asserts expressly&mdash;Bestia
illa de Apocalypsi, cui datum est os loquens blasphemias,
et bellum gerere cum sanctis, <span class="smcap">Petri cathedram
occupat</span>, tanquam leo paratus ad pr&aelig;dam. Ep.
cxxv: which was, in other words, to call the Pope, Antichrist.
It is evident that St. Bernard applied the prophecies
in the Revelation to the successor of St. Peter.&mdash;I
mention these things so particularly, to shew, what his
sentiments on this head really were; which have been misrepresented
by hasty writers, who transcribe from each
other, without examining, themselves, the authorities, they
quote.</p></div>

<i>Pars Post.</i> p. 681. Ed. Franc. 1601.&mdash;In this age
[XIIth], was composed a very remarkable tract on the
subject of Antichrist, which may be seen in Mede’s Works,
p. 721.&mdash;Mr. Mede supposes, and seems indeed to have
proved, that the <i>true</i> doctrine of Antichrist was, and was
intended to be, a mystery, or secret, till the 12th century.
Whence it follows that the testimonies, hitherto alledged,
are only passionate or declamatory exaggerations, or to be
esteemed, as he says, <i>pro parabolic&egrave; et</i> κάτ’ αὔξησιν <i>dictis,
declamatorum more</i>. <i>Works</i>, p. 722.</p>

<p>I admit the truth of the observation: but hold, that the
<i>use</i> of the deduction, here made, is not in the least affected
by it. For my purpose in giving this catalogue of witnesses
to the doctrine of Antichrist, was not to <i>justify</i> that
doctrine, in the <i>true</i>, that is, Protestant sense of it (for
then, not only the preceding testimonies, but even some
of the following, would have been omitted) but merely to
shew that the general, at least, and confused idea of some
such doctrine did, in fact, <i>subsist</i> in the ancient Christian
church. That what idea they had of this doctrine was
founded on the <i>prophecies</i>, is clear from the terms in which
they express themselves. And, though the doctrine itself
was very imperfectly conceived, and inconsequentially applied
by them, still their language shews that they had
some notion of <i>a corrupt spiritual power, which was</i>, in
their sense of the prophets, <i>to domineer in the church of
Rome</i>: whence I draw this conclusion (for the sake of
which, this whole deduction is made), That the present
application of the prophecies concerning Antichrist to
papal Rome, is not wholly new and unauthorized; as the
prejudice, I am here combating, supposeth it to be.</p></div>

<p>Numberless passages in the writings of Petrarch speak
of Rome, under the name of <i>Babylon</i>. But an equal stress
is not to be laid on all of these. It should be remembered,
that the Popes, in Petrarch’s time, resided at Avignon;
greatly to the disparagement of themselves, as he thought,
and especially of Rome; of which this singular man was
little less than idolatrous. The situation of the place, surrounded
by waters, and his splenetic concern for the
<i>exiled</i> Church (for under this idea, he painted to himself
the Pope’s migration to the banks of Avignon) brought to
his mind the condition of the Jewish church in the Babylonian
captivity. And this parallel was all, perhaps, that
he meant to insinuate in most of those passages. But,
when he applies the prophecies to Rome, as to the <i>Apocalyptic</i>
Babylon (as he clearly does in the epistle under
consideration) his meaning is not equivocal: and we do
him but justice to give him an honourable place among
the <span class="smcap">Testes Veritatis</span>.</p></div>

M. d’Alembert, indeed, goes further. He acquaints
us, that this <i>charge</i> is now out of date, and that nobody,
either within or without the Romish communion, makes
it any longer. For, speaking of a public inscription at
Geneva, in which <i>the Pope is called Antichrist</i>, he animadverts
on this disgrace of that Protestant people, and very
kindly suggests to them what their improved sentiments
and language should be on that subject. <i>As for the Catholics</i>
(says he, very gravely,) <i>the Pope is regarded by
them, as the Head of the true Church: By sage and moderate
Protestants, he is seen in the light of a sovereign prince,
whom they respect, though they do not obey him: But, in
an age like this,</i> <span class="smcap">he is no longer Antichrist in the
opinion of anybody</span>. “Pour les Catholiques, le Pape

As to the <i>authority</i> of this extraordinary book (although
the discussion of this point be foreign to my present
purpose) it may be proper to acquaint such persons,
as have not made the inquiry for themselves, and are perhaps
incapable of making it, with the sentiments, which
our ablest writers have entertained of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Mede, a capable inquirer, if there ever was any,
says roundly&mdash;“The Apocalypse hath more human (not
to speak of <i>divine</i>) authority, than any other book of the
New Testament besides, even from the time it was first
delivered.” <i>Works</i>, p. 602.</p>

<p>&mdash;And to the same purpose, Sir Isaac Newton&mdash;“I do
not find any other book of the New Testament so
strongly attested, or commented upon so early, as this
of the Apocalypse.” <i>Observations on Daniel</i>, &amp;c. page
249.</p>

<p>Thus, these two incomparable men. What some minute
critics have said, or insinuated to the contrary, is not
worth mentioning; farther, than just to observe, that, if
the authority of this momentous book be indeed questionable,
the church of Rome could hardly have failed long
since to make the discovery, or to triumph in it.</p>

The learned Bishop Andrews says expressly&mdash;“You
shall scarce find a phrase in the Revelations of St. John,
that is not taken out of Daniel, or some other prophet.”

Daniele, vel ex alio aliquo prophet&acirc; desumptam.</i> Resp. ad

An eminent writer gives an exact idea of it, in these
words&mdash;“The style [of the Revelations] is very prophetical,
as to the things spoken: And very hebraizing, as
to the speaking of them. Exceeding much of the old
prophets language and matter adduced to intimate new
stories: And exceeding much of the Jews language and
allusion to their customs and opinions, thereby to speak
the things more familiarly to be understood.” Dr.
<span class="smcap">Lightfoot</span>, <i>Harm. of the N. T.</i> p. 154, London, 1655.</p></div>

I have heard it affirmed, on good grounds, that the
late Dr. Samuel Clarke, being asked in conversation by a
friend, whether, as he had taken much pains to interpret
the other books of Scripture, he had never attempted any
thing on the Revelations, replied, <i>He had not; but that,
notwithstanding, he thought he understood every word of it</i>:
Not meaning, we may be sure, that he knew how to apply
every part of that prophecy, but that he understood
the <i>phraseology</i>, in which it was written; which a man, so
conversant as he was in the style of scripture, might very
well do.&mdash;Calvin, indeed, has been commended for making
the opposite declaration: And, it may be, with good
reason: For (not to derogate in any respect from the character
of this great man) the language of the Scriptures,
and especially of the prophetical scriptures, was in no degree
so well understood in his time, as it was in that of
Dr. S. Clarke.</p></div>

M. Jurieu, whose indiscretions afforded, indeed, ample
scope for the raillery of this lively prelate. Mr. Mede was
not a man to be confuted in this way, and still less by a
fanciful and ill-supported <i>Exposition of the Apocalypse</i>.</p></div>

<i>should enable him to keep a horse, for his recreation,

The reader may form a distinct idea of the method, in
which the <i>whole</i> book of the Apocalypse is disposed, by
observing that it is resolvable into <small>THREE</small> great parts.</p>

<p>The <small>FIRST</small> part, is that of the <span class="smcap">Epistles</span> to the seven
churches, contained in the three first chapters, and is not
at all considered by Mr. Mede.</p>

<p>The <small>SECOND</small> part (with which Mr. Mede begins his commentary)
is that of the <span class="smcap">Sealed Book</span>, from ch. iv. to ch.
x; and contains <i>the fates of the Empire</i>, or its civil revolutions,
yet, with a reference, still, to the state and fortune
of the Christian Church.</p>

<p>The <small>THIRD</small> part, is that of the <small>OPEN BOOK</small>, with what
follows to the end; and exhibits in a more minute and
extended view, <i>the fates of the Christian Church</i>, especially
during its Apostacy, and after its recovery from it.</p>

<p>This <small>THIRD</small> division may, further, be considered as
consisting of <small>TWO</small> parts. The <small>FIRST</small> contains, in ch. xi,
a summary view of what should befal the Christian Church,
contemporary with the events deduced in the <i>second</i> part
concerning the Empire; and is given in this place, in
order to connect the <i>second</i> and <i>third</i> parts, and to shew
their correspondence and contemporaneity. See Mr.
Mede’s Clavis, p. 424; and Comment. Apocalypt. p. 476.</p>

<p>The <small>SECOND</small> part of the last division, from ch. xii. to
the end, gives a detailed account of what should befal the
Christian Church in distinct, and, several of them, synchronical
visions.</p>

<p>It has been thought by some an objection to Mr. Mede’s
scheme, “That the prophecy of the <i>open book</i>, (which
contains, according to him, all the remaining visions to
the end of the Revelations) is not only, for the <i>subject</i>,
more considerable, but, for the <i>size</i> of the volume, larger,
than the Prophecy of the <i>sealed book</i>; whereas, the name
given to it, βιβλαρίδιον, or <i>little book</i>, seems very clearly to
express the contrary.”</p>

<p>If this objection be thought material (for I do not find
that Mr. Mede condescends to take any notice of it) it
<i>might</i>, perhaps, be obviated by supposing, That the <i>little
book</i> contains the xith chapter, only, being a compendium
of the <i>third</i> division, and inserted in this place to shew the
contemporaneity of the <i>two last</i> and principal parts; and
that all which follows to the end, is to be regarded as a
sort of <i>comment</i> on the little book, or larger explication of
its contents: As if the design had been to consult our
weakness, in presenting us, <i>first</i>, with an abridged view
of a great scheme, and <i>then</i>, in drawing it out at large,
for our more distinct information.</p>

<p>But the <i>truer</i> answer to the difficulty I take to be, That
the <i>sealed book</i> is represented under the idea of a <i>book</i>,
properly so called, which, upon being opened, presents to
the eye the several objects and schemes of the prophecy,
distinctly delineated on the <i>roll</i>, or volume, when it comes
to be unfolded, and which, therefore, must needs be considered
as a <i>large</i> one. The <i>open book</i>, on the other hand,
is to be regarded, not as a real, but <i>metaphorical</i> book;
and is not produced to be read or contemplated, after a
gradual evolution of it, but to be <i>eaten</i>, at once, by the
prophet; like that book, to which it alludes, and from
which the imagery is taken, in the visions of Ezekiel [ii.
8. and iii. 1, 2, 3.]&mdash;to <i>eat a book</i>, being, in the hieroglyphics,
to <i>meditate upon</i>, and to <i>digest</i>, its contents. So
that this book, to distinguish it from the other, is named
a <i>little book</i>: not, that the revelations, conveyed by it, are
less considerable, or less numerous, than the other, but
that the <i>use</i>, to which it is put, required only that it should
be spoken of, as a <i>book</i> simply; the diminutive form being
here suggested in the term βιβλαρίδιον, that the metaphor
of <i>eating</i> it might seem the easier; and (because the
former <i>sealed</i> book was of an immense size) might, under
this idea, present itself the more naturally, and give less
offence, to the imagination.</p></div>

I am not ignorant that many interpreters have thought
otherwise. But possibly they have not enough attended to
the advice, which Mr. Mede used to give to such of his
friends as did not enter into his ideas&mdash;<span class="smcap">Expende</span>. My
meaning is, that, if they had possessed the patience, or
the sagacity, to understand this great Inventor, before they
objected to him, they would perhaps have seen cause to
acquiesce in the <i>Method</i>, pointed out by him, instead of
attempting in various ways, and to little purpose, to improve
upon it.</p></div>

The reason I take to be, That <i>fornication</i>, that is,
vague lust, and general prostitution, served best to express
the unbridled and indiscriminate passion of the Jews
for the d&aelig;mon-worship of their neighbours: Whereas the
crime of <i>adultery</i>, though of a blacker dye, and, in that
view, more proper to expose the malignity of their offence,
does not convey the same ideas of universal pollution,
being usually committed, <i>because</i> it is so criminal, with
more distinction and restraint.</p></div>

Not held of the civil power, or acknowledged to be so
held, but usurped upon it, and insolently directed against
it; as is well known from ecclesiastical history. <i>The Pope
is not Antichrist: God forbid!</i> (says the good Abb&eacute; Fleury,
with a zeal becoming a member of the Papal communion.)
<i>But neither is he impeccable, nor has he an absolute authority
in the church over all things both temporal and spiritual</i>&mdash;<i>Le
pape n’est pas l’Antichrist; &agrave; Dieu ne plaise; mais il
n’est pas impeccable, ni monarque absolu dans l’eglise pour le
temporel et pour le spirituel</i> [4<sup>eme</sup> <i>disc. sur l’hist. ecclesiastique</i>,
p. 173. Par. 1747, 12<sup>o</sup>.]</p>

<p>The Pope, he says, <i>is not an absolute monarch in the
church over all things temporal and spiritual</i>: That is, he
<i>ought not</i> to arrogate to himself the power of an absolute
monarch; for that the pope assumes to be such a monarch,
and, in fact, exercised this supreme monarchical power in
the church, through many ages, the learned and candid
writer had indisputably shewn, in the discourse, whence
these words are quoted. But now this <i>monarchical sovereignty
in all things temporal, as well us spiritual</i>, is certainly
one prophetical note or character, by which the
person or power, styled Antichristian, is distinguished.

In the <i>persecution of heretics</i>; which M. Bossuet regards
as so little dishonourable to his communion, that he
thinks it <i>a point not to be called in question</i>&mdash;calls the use
of the sword in matters of religion, <i>an undoubted right</i>&mdash;and
concludes, that <i>there is no illusion more dangerous than
to consider</i> <small>TOLERATION</small>, <i>as a mark of the true Church</i>&mdash;<i>l’exercise
de la puissance du glaive dans les matieres de la religion
&amp; de la conscience; chose, que ne pe&ucirc;t &ecirc;tre revoqu&eacute;e
en doute&mdash;le droit est certain&mdash;il n’y a point d’illusion plus
dangereuse que de donner</i> <small>LA SOUFFRANCE</small> <i>pour un caractere
le vraye Eglise</i>. <i>Hist. des Var.</i> l. x. p. 51. Par. 1740, 12<sup>o</sup>.</p>

<p>Thus, this great doctor of the Catholic church, towards
the close of the last century. And just now, another eminent
writer of that communion very roundly defends the
murder of the Bohemian martyrs at Constance, and (what
is more provoking still) the <i>fraud and ill-faith</i>, through
which the pious and tender-hearted <i>Fathers</i> of that council
rushed to the perpetration of it. <i>M. Crevier, Hist. de
l’Universit&eacute; de Paris</i>, t. iii. l. vi. p. 435, &amp;c. Par. 1761,
12<sup>o</sup>.&mdash;Can it be worth while to spend words in fixing this
charge of <i>intolerance</i> on the church of Rome, when her
ablest advocates, as we see, even in our days, openly triumph
in it? But, then, hath she forgotten who it was
that the prophet <i>saw, drunken with the blood of the saints,
and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus</i>&mdash;Rev. xvii; 6?.
Alas, no: But she wonders, by what figure of speech <i>heretics</i>
are called <i>Saints</i>; and <i>rebels to the Pope</i>, <i>Martyrs of
Jesus</i>.</p></div>

See Vitringa <i>Apocalyps. Exp.</i> p. 603, and the authors
cited by him: But, above all, see Mr. Mede’s exquisite
and unanswerable discourse, entitled, <i>The Apostacy of the
latter times</i>.</p>

<p>’Tis true, the Bishop of Meaux is pleased to divert himself
with one part of this discourse; I mean, that part,
which contains [ch. xvi. and xvii.] the learned writer’s interpretation
of Daniel’s prophecy, concerning the Gods
<i>Mahuzzim</i>. He finds something pleasant in this idea, or
rather in this hard word, which he repeats so often, and
in such a way, as if he thought the very sound of <i>Mahuzzim</i>,
was enough to expose the comment and Commentator
to contempt. <i>Hist. des Var.</i> l. xiii. p. 260, 261. But,
after all, the ingenious Prelate would have done himself
no discredit by being a little more serious in discussing an
interpretation, which Sir Isaac Newton adopts without
scruple [<i>Obs. on the prophecies of Daniel, &amp;c.</i> p. 192]; and
which, in mere respect to the prophet, he should, at
least, have condescended to replace by some other and
more reasonable interpretation. But it is the infirmity of
this lively man, to be jocular <i>out of season</i>. Thus, again,
he raillies Luther, for an assertion of his, delivered, it
seems, with some assurance, and, in the form, as he pretends,
of a prediction, <i>That the Papal power would speedily
decline and come to nothing, in consequence of the Reformation</i>.
The event, he says, has belied the prophet; the
Pope still keeps his ground; and then (in an unlucky parenthesis)
laughs to think, <i>how many others, besides Luther,
will be dashed to pieces against this</i> <small>STONE</small>&mdash;<i>bien d’autres,
que Luther, se briseront contre cette</i> <small>PIERRE</small> [<i>Var.</i> l. xiii. p.
244]. Now, if the glory of saying a good thing had not
infatuated this Catholic Bishop, could he have helped starting
at his own comparison of a <i>stone</i>, as applied to Luther
and the Reformation, when it might so naturally have put
him in mind of that prophetical <small>STONE</small>, which shall one
day <i>become a great mountain</i>, and <i>break in pieces a certain</i>
<small>IMAGE</small>, <i>and stand for ever</i> [Dan. ii. 35, 44.]?</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
